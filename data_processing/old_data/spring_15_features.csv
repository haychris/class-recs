The seminar will thus start with the questions of defining epoch and style. As the Baroque is one of the first transcultural phenomena  we will add to our readings of German Baroque those of Shakespeare and Caldéron. This broadly \"cultural\" character also means that the Baroque cannot be restricted to a narrowly textual phenomenon; the Baroque  rather  is multimedia in character. Hence  we will complement our readings of literature and philosophy with excursions into the fine arts and musical performance."
