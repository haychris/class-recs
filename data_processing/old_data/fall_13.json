Topics include natural history, cell theory, eugenics and its relationship to genetics, evolution and Darwin's contribution of natural selection, ecology, molecular biology, biotechnology, and genomics/proteomics.", "termid": "1142", "classes": [{"classnum": "20829", "enroll": "17", "limit": "18", "starttime": "11:00 am", "section": "L01", "endtime": "12:20 pm", "roomnum": "101", "days": "MW", "bldg": "Marx Hall"}]},
