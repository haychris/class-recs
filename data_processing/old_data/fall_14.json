Specific topics will include: the evolution of cooperation and of social behavior from bacteria to humans; the evolution of multicellularity; the somatic evolution of cancer; virus dynamics (within host and within populations); and multispecies interactions and the evolution of mutualisms.", "termid": "1152", "classes": [{"classnum": "21465", "enroll": "30", "limit": "50", "starttime": "3:00 pm", "section": "L01", "endtime": "4:20 pm", "roomnum": "138", "days": "TTh", "bldg": "Lewis Library"}, {"classnum": "24551", "enroll": "14", "limit": "20", "starttime": "2:30 pm", "section": "P01", "endtime": "3:20 pm", "roomnum": "A30", "days": "M", "bldg": "Princeton Neuroscience Institu"}, {"classnum": "24552", "enroll": "16", "limit": "20", "starttime": "10:00 am", "section": "P02", "endtime": "10:50 am", "roomnum": "209", "days": "F", "bldg": "Frist Campus Center"}]},
