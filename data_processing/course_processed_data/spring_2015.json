Lots of philosophy majors or people who've taken philosophy classes before though.", "Morison is a terrific professor--get into his precept if you can. He is very clear and also keeps things playful. This class is a good intro to Aristotle for any level, whether a philosophy senior or a freshman who has no philosophical experience.

Lectures are spectacular; he is engaging, hilarious, and presents the material extraordinarily well. Try to get his precept if you can. Two pieces of advice: 1) do the readings for the first half after lecture, as they are very difficult without having someone first explain them to you. 2) do readings slowly and carefully. Seemingly small nuances are very important in the assignments. Definitely take this class if you have any interest in Aristotle or philosophy whatsoever. Morison really makes this course great; I would be wary in future years if someone else taught it, however, as the material can get tricky.", "Professor Morison is a WONDERFUL teacher and person, and it's such a privilege to be able to learn from him.

You won't regret a fantastic intro class to Aristotle.", "The lectures and precepts are very good, and the assignments are thought-provoking and fair, although the grading curve is tough! Lectures and precepts are very engaging. The philosophy in this class is quite technical though, and less practical.", "This class will make you a better person.", "This class will teach you to read and interpret classical texts, and an introduction to Aristotlean philosophy.", "This course actually has some practical value in terms of what it teaches you about ethics and happiness. The first half  of the semester isn't that exciting but the second one is quit the opposite. It's an easy EC. I was going to pdf it, but ended up taking it for a grade.", "This course provides a strong interpretation of particularly relevant sections of Categories, Prior Analytics, Physics, and Nicomachean Ethics.", "This is a great class! Aristotle is amazing, especially his Ethics. It's not too much work at all and is completely OK for a non-philosophy major, too.", "This is a nice course. You'll learn Aristotle the right way, which often requires moving through texts slowly. I wouldn't say you read Aristotle, but you learn Aristotle, which is more important in my estimation. The course has assignments every two weeks or so, I think there are 6 in total. The curve on these are pretty tough though, sometimes 100-99 = A and 98-96 = A-, ... tough.

The next day, I was feeling under-the-weather after staying up super late the night before to finish some work for my classes, so I slept through lecture.  Turns out the professor decided to follow up her promise of \"it's OK to miss lecture\" with a pop quiz.  These (open-note) quizzes would occur every week or two after that, and would consist of one or two VERY EASY questions on the course material, and two or three questions such as \"what is your name\" or \"what is your favorite thing about spring\".  Thus, they were used only as a tactic to force us to come to lecture, not to gauge understanding of course material.  I resented that we were forced to attend based on these quizzes, rather than being encouraged to attend by engaging lectures.\n*****\nI also felt that the readings were much longer and more dense than necessary.  Most of the 20-page readings felt like they could be summarized in 1 or 2 pages--and they often were on the lecture slides.  We had to write weekly precept responses, which were annoyingly time-consuming but as much based on personal opinion as on the readings.  Coming out of the course, I don't feel like I've learned much.\n*****\nTL;DR:  Take the class if you want an easy PDF or A.

I again poured hours of work into the course but ultimately regret taking this second semester. Professor Shaevitz trivialized our questions, which discouraged us from asking when we did not understand. He would never admit that he didn't know the answer to any question, nor did he ever say that any question was intriguing or even at all worthwhile asking. I came into Princeton motivated to do science and thought that ISC would be the place to go. The fall semester proved successful, but the spring semester discouraged me from pursuing science.

While the electricity and magnetism portion of this semester isn't necessarily presented in the most interesting manner, I really enjoyed the quantum material we covered, as well as some of the short interludes of biology. Unless the lecture notes are revised for next year, they will probably be pretty useless, at least for your first pass through the material, since they don't explain the material very well or thoroughly (though they're good as a summary or review). Consulting a real textbook instead would probably be helpful (definitely read Griffiths for quantum if you're interested in actually understanding the material!). Unlike last semester, the problems on the exams this semester seemed very different than the problems we did in problem sets or in class; while studying and reviewing the material in preparation for exams is beneficial for your own personal knowledge and learning, it probably won't make a lot of difference in terms of actually preparing you for the exam problems.

Second, Prof. Liu genuinely cares about the students and their learning progress --- in the middle of the semester, he lightened up the workload significantly in response to student feedback.  Third, he's very humble for a Princeton professor. I've had some professors at this school who would never ever admit that they are wrong or that they don't fully understand a concept.

Highly recommended course for all ORF and COS majors.", "This course is really useful, and Professor Liu's lectures are fantastic. You absolutely cannot skip lectures. There are no precepts and no textbook, so going to every lecture is the only way to learn. Take good notes, and take advantage of all opportunities to ask questions in lecture.

I was amazed at the resources that are used on this class. Just looking at the lab, the amount of TAs, teachers, and materials used on this lab is really pretty cool. That being said, it was a great class - because it showed me that I don't want to be a chemical engineer.  It is sad that this class comes so late in the CBE program because it is really the first introduction to what chemical engineers do.  And frankly, measuring hot fast rods heat up or how dye moves through a polymer isn't how I imagine most people want to spend their jobs.  \n\nIn terms of grading, the course is so subjective it is comical.  The difference between professors is huge and whoever is the grader makes all the difference. Another huge difference is the TA you get for each lab, some are very helpful, others not so much so it really influences your grade.  But back to subjectivity, you will work hard for a presentation to have it be argued that you had lines on a graph where there shouldnt be and one of the two professors didn't like that.  It's sad that most of the time, the professors would rather not help the student and criticize them for not understanding material during a presentation or lab report instead of trying to help the student understand the material before hand. It's almost like the professors specifically don't try and help the student so they will be able to criticize them later.  \n\nMy best advice is to choose a partner that you know you will get along with and will get the work done and don't take it too seriously. You will be working late nights, you will spend way too much time on your lab reports, you will lose time you normally spend on other assignments for this class, and yet, you will be criticized for things you would never know or have thought to think about and you will be criticized for stylistic things that don't actually matter.  So, have fun in the lab, order pizza for late night lab sessions, and blast some music.. and DON'T take it too seriously.

On the other hand, if you've done Con Interp, this course is a breeze. I found the readings and papers to be fast and easy, but they would probably be tough if you've never read Supreme Court opinions before.

The final project was one of my favorite parts of the course. You and a parter have to research a start up company and then give a funding pitch as if you were the company's founders.

The midterm was a written analysis of a company and the final was a pitch to Kuenne about a company as well. These felt like a great way to apply our knowledge.

Though the course is quite challenging, I loved it, and learned a lot--I highly recommend this for anybody who loves to learn things rigorously, from the ground up, especially a subject which stands above all others in importance in any mathematical, scientific, or engineering field!", "Definitely start your problem sets early if possible. They can be very time-consuming and long, but they are important if you want to really understand the material. Do the readings too - the book is very clear.", "Definitely take it!

While you probably had some sort of intuition for 215 just by virtue of taking AP Calculus, 217 is completely different on the level that it is much, much more abstract and is, of course, an introduction to algebra, which not many high schools teach students. So if you take this class, realize that you will be completely lost when Professor Sarnak talks about winding numbers and dual spaces and double duals, you will suffer through long problem sets that don't seem to make any sense, you will pull a 5-day continuous all-nighter finishing the take-home midterm, you will doubt your own intelligence and your sanity, you will see hell.

But it didn't matter, because Professor Sarnak (and more importantly, Gauss) were there to save the day. Oof, Sarnak is the best: he not only made all the lectures really fun and interesting, but too did something that I found somewhat surprising: covered the bases (ha) for both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject. Most math courses seem to disregard the practical aspects, but I found that these were quite important for a first year course, which made Sarnak a very interesting teacher. Thus, the material and lectures were both incredible. As with 215, the problem sets are oftentimes challenging, but rewarding.

Many of the things you learn about will be discouraging, but they're important to understand and Ruha prepares you to take on a more activist role once you leave the classroom.

This course was the most important one I took during the year, and I would not be surprised if it is the most important course I take during my four years at Princeton. Prof. B. is a wonderful professor -- she is smart and cares deeply about what she is teaching and for her students. She always pushes us to stretch our minds and think more critically. I have learned so much about race and racism in America, a topic that is so important for understanding U.S. history and society today. The key part of the course is the \"now what\" and it is so helpful to think about how we can change the state of race relations in the U.S. and combat the racism that exists in today's institutions.

I highly recommend it, given that Professor Boulanger not only teaches you a lot about the field of neuroimmunology, but also about how to analyze the primary literature.", "This is an amazing course! But, this is not a course where you will be lectured about topics in neuroimmunology. Instead, you'll have papers to read each week relating to neuroimmunology and you'll just discuss the papers during class, which, by the way, is very enjoyable. The workload is not too crazy and the class itself is obviously very interesting. Keep in mind though, that you're just talking about the papers for three hours. But, it's still super fun and interesting and Dr. Boulanger keeps the conversation lively. You'll definitely come out of this class with a better appreciation for scientific writing and research, and your skills in these areas will improve too!", "This was a really difficult course.

However, there are still a lot of interesting texts covered by this course, so don't be afraid to continue the course!", "If you took the first semester of HUM, I cannot recommend highly enough that you complete the entire sequence. Distribution and concentration requirements will still be there next year; the opportunity to complete the HUM Sequence with your cohort won't be. If you're concerned about writing sem or having to take 5 classes in the spring, it is doable. There were a number of us who had HUM and writing sem as part of a 5-class spring semester, and while it was an absurd amount of writing, it was manageable and absolutely worthwhile. Advice includes: try to get at least a bit ahead on reading over Intersession and Spring Break, be on top of your game with consistent time management, and utilize the Writing Center and your grader's office hours for the papers.\n\nFor someone who hasn't taken HUM 216-217, I still highly recommend taking this course because even just one semester of HUM is an amazing intellectual experience. That said, I recommend that you consider waiting to take HUM 216-217 in the fall so you can take the entire sequence with HUM 218-219 the following spring. There's a real benefit to taking the entire sequence, and it is also totally doable for upperclassmen to take HUM (we had a sophomore in our class who loved it).", "If you're looking at this course evaluation, you're either a fall HUM student looking to continue or someone who might join mid-year. In either case, you should sign up for HUM 218-219. It is fantastic with great professors in the spring and great readings. If you did it in the fall, as Professor Feeney has said you need \"to complete the telos\" and take it in the spring to reach modernity and be fully enlightened.", "It may be more difficult to do the second half of the course due to spring semester's faster pace, but it is well worth it. I found that having HUM count as two classes was extremely helpful. It is possible to get the whole experience of the course by focusing on several readings you really enjoy and skimming the rest. While the pace and content is much different from that of HUM 216-217, the course still provides a good overview of how philosophy, literature, and the arts intersect with history. This year was heavy on German philosophy, but Kant is well worth reading--Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche are influential but still sophists. A lot of my classmates disliked Descartes, but he is unique as the bridge between ancient and modern; he uses the old dialectical method which I found entertaining.", "It's HUM. It's legendary for a reason. I don't how next semester's massive enrollment expansion will affect the quality of the course (I fear it will lose a measure of its camaraderie and close-knit community feel) but I'm sure it will still be more than worthwhile. It's a lot, but it's worth it.", "It's a significant time commitment, and a lot of reading, but it's extremely worthwhile and any student interested in the humanities should strongly consider this sequence.", "Read on time. It sounds cliche, but this course truly will be as helpful to you as you make it. No one will be checking up on you to make sure you are doing the reading - so be accountable to yourself and maybe even find other friends in the course who you can be accountable to to make sure you are doing the reading.", "Second semester HUM was not as good as first semester HUM for me, but that could have been a result of the specific professors teaching the course and the fact that I did less reading. I guess my advice would be if you take second semester, try to stay on top of the readings still, because you will have less motivation, but enjoyment of the class is definitely proportional to the amount you read.", "TAKE IT", "TAKE IT! I'm going to start with the negatives, but read through this whole evaluation to get my positives at the end. I was disappointed by this semester as compared to first semester. HUM 218-219 was poorly organized in several ways: readings were not listed accurately on the syllabus, and we would only receive exact page selections in scattered emails containing Blackboard announcements; nobody told the students in advance that they needed to distinguish between specific works of certain authors like Montaigne and Leibniz for the final exam; preceptors especially at the beginning of the semester often had students give very general or fluffy comments on the texts, or dominated the conversation by essentially turning precept into lecture; the papers were spaced badly so that originally there was no Dean's Date paper and they all would have been due two weeks apart, crammed into February through April; the person giving the philosophy lectures (Daniel Cloud) was ineffective, etc. In spite of all these concerns, I greatly enjoyed HUM 218-219 for the many excellent lectures, precepts and readings whose high quality carried over from first semester, and I felt that I learned and grew exponentially by not only taking the first semester, but also completing the entire sequence. If you can only take one or the other, fall HUM is much more important and more formative--with more essential texts and, in 2014-2015, better professors and precepts--than spring HUM, and students are also more engaged and on top of their readings in fall HUM. The drop-off in student preparation reduces the quality of discussions in the spring, but this decline is compensated in part by the benefit of better knowing your classmates and therefore being able to anticipate and respond to their comments more. If at all possible, I would recommend taking both fall and spring HUM; the texts you read, the people you befriend and the conversations you have are really a magical experience that you cannot get elsewhere at this University. I also found that I grew greatly as a writer throughout HUM; the papers came much more easily to me after the first or second one of the spring. I feel that I am leaving the HUM Sequence with much better writing skills, improved speaking skills, appreciation for and much greater awareness of the trajectory of Western culture, friends who are like me interested in humanistic inquiry, and a sharper and more insightful mind. Anyone who likes to read and has an interest in the HUM Sequence should sign up: it will change your life, and I am so thankful for this opportunity.", "Take it!

Don't you dare miss a single lecture, they are worth gold and more and must not be missed. I admired every moment of this class and it hit a special place in my heart. I was saddened to realize that I know nothing of the history of my Latino heritage. I thank Robert Karl from here on out for helping me learn of who I am and what my people can become.

It gives you a broad overview of Latin American history since 1810 and provides you a sense of what was happening in many different countries during this time. Professor Karl is a great professor and lecturer. He knows a lot about Latin America, and it is obvious that he cares deeply about his students. I would highly recommend this course to others.", "This course is very important to unlearning US-centric misconceptions about Latin America, especially if you're going into politics/WWS. I highly recommend taking HIS 303 with Candiani first to get the colonial basis, but Prof Karl does a good summary of that course and this covers independence up to present day Latin America. There's a lot of national case studies with emphasis on politics, the state, national and global economy, etc. Readings work as a supplement, they're usually engaging but can be pretty lengthy.
