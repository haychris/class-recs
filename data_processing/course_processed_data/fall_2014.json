Graziano is an amazing lecturer and no prior knowledge needed.", "Definitely take it! Graziano is a great lecturer, learn very interesting things about the brain you didn't know before.", "Definitely take it, but watch out for the small details. Record the lectures!", "Do not be fooled by the story-telling lecture way of professor Graziano The story telling part is important. Take good notes!!! Although the multiple choice format of the exams sounds easy, there were not for me. The exams got harder each time. I wish I could have found friends to study with for the exams. Study with friends!!", "Don't buy the textbook. Attend lectures and record them.", "Don't get discouraged if you don't know something, literally everyone encounters that in this subject I think. Focus more on understanding and being able to work with a lot of things.", "Don't skip lecture! The textbook is helpful for only a few weeks.", "Easy course but very good intro o neuro and helps understanding some of our daily life.", "Enjoy it, and you will learn more and better. Also, take very detailed notes, maybe exchange notes with friends, and don't study only on the night before an exam.", "GO TO LECTURE", "GO TO LECTURE. You don't even have to buy the textbook or read it at all - everything is based off of lectures, and Graziano knows enough that you will probably learn a lot anyway.

I miss two lectures and screwed up the following exam! The textbook won't help you much beyond the first few weeks so don't underestimate good note taking and studying!", "Go to lecture!!

Go to lecture.", "Graziano is an amazing, funny, and engaging lecturer. Take this class. The material is fascinating and thought-provoking. TAKE REALLY GOOD NOTES AND GO TO LECTURE. The tests are entirely based off of what he says, anything he says, from anecdotes to pathways. Take it, take it, take it and enjoy.", "Graziano is cool. Exams are easy if you go to lecture and write down every word. Material is fairly interesting, but 258 is definitely a foundation for higher-level NEU courses and feels a bit like AP Bio sometimes", "Great class! The subject is very interesting, and Graziano is a good lecturer. It's also very little work. The textbook readings are neither mandatory or relevant for tests (you can do them if you're interested), and besides that, there were literally only 3 journal articles that we had to read throughout the entire semester. The tests aren't easy, but there are only 4 of them, and the rest of the semester you have almost no work, literally. Would be a good fifth class.", "Great course, you'll learn a lot of interesting material", "I love Graziano. He's a great professor and his lectures are very engaging and fascinating. You should definitely take this class if you are even remotely interested in neuroscience.", "I love this course! Make sure you go to lecture, and pay attention! Some students record the lecture, and that would probably be very helpful.", "I would advise students to be prepared for a difficult class if they are more humanities/social science oriented. Many students who take this class really love neuroscience, so those not as strong in the sciences should be forewarned.", "I would tell them to try and write down every word out of the lecturer's mouth.", "If you are interested in neuroscience, this is a very detailed class but it is heavily memory based and requires you to memorize many facts that are often times hard to put into a more general context.", "If you are not required to take this course, but sure you are prepared to make it a priority, or to PDF. It isn't a great general interest class if you're interested in getting an A.", "If you don't like memorization, or at least is capable of doing it, be cautious about taking this class. It's a lot of material and not easy to breeze through.", "If you have a sound recorder, use that to record the material in the lecture because the professor doesn't use lecture slides and instead writes on the chalkboard. Even if you take good notes, there might be a random fact you forgot to write down that will appear on the exams.", "If you think this will be a fun way to do your STN, you're wrong.", "If you're interested in the subject and willing to put in the time to study a lot of detail prior to exams, I'd recommend the class.", "If you're not sure you'll like it, you might be surprised! You need to be motivated to do well, though, and you need to be able to pay close attention and take careful notes during lecture. Otherwise it might start to drag on for you and you might get lost.", "Interesting class.", "It is a very, very difficult course to dive straight into, but also very, very worthwhile. Studying is recommended, it makes a huge difference.", "It is a wonderful course whether you have previous experience in neuroscience or not.  It might be helpful to review high school level biology prior to the first unit, but other than that, just take good notes in the lectures and study them for the tests.", "It might sound super easy because it is multiple choice but don't understudy. You will end up having to break your butt studying for the next tests to bring up your average.", "It's a great class if you're interested in neuroscience. Prof. Graziano is a great lecturer. Just know that the field (and the class) mostly involve memorization of lots of facts -- I thought I was interested in neuroscience, but less so after I realized that.", "It's a great course to take if you're interested in neuroscience and/or if you need to fulfill an STN.", "It's not too difficult as long as you go to all the lectures and pay attention and memorize the stuff. Not really a great pdf class cause you really have to learn it all and pay attention in order to pass the tests, and most people do extremely well on them making the curve not helpful.  Don't skip class.", "It's rather easy and if you need an STN, and have some interest in neuroscience, take the course.", "Lots of information you learn and very easy.", "Make sure to go to all the lectures: the course is not based on the textbook.", "Make sure you exchange notes with multiple people before each test. Study ALL the details. Know your anatomy. The course had no real homework, apart from intense cramming before tests.", "No slides, guided notes, etc. Hard to follow everything in the lecture and take down all of the notes. Lots of memorization. I spent a lot of time on wikipedia and in the textbook to organize my notes. Kinda disorganized, but exams were straightforward.", "Not a bad PDF at all, and you learn a ton.", "Overall this is a good course to fulfill an STN, although it is a bit harder than I had expected. Mostly there's a lot of really teeny (and less interesting) details to memorize, so how you do in the class will mostly depend on how much effort you put into very detail-oriented memorization. You should also know that this class is mostly focused on systems such as how the eyes and ears work with the brain, meaning that you learn a lot of neuroanatomy as opposed to cognitive neuroscience.", "Record lectures, get every single detail for the exams.", "Record the lectures and take notes again while listening to the recordings. By basically transcribing the lectures and then reviewing the notes/quizzing yourself, you can do well on all the exams. I never got the book and never opened it, so don't bother purchasing it. Go to precept... I didn't realize it factored into my grade! woops.", "TAKE IT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW AT LEAST A LITTLE ABOUT NEURO!!!! AND ITS FUN EASY INTERESTING YAYYY", "TAKE IT!", "TAKE IT!!!! It is the most interesting class that provides you with an essential insight into how your brain, your mind, works.", "TAKE THIS CLASS", "Take a lot of lecture notes.", "Take a lot of notes and really good notes. Do not assume any part of lecture is an aside or unimportant for exams. Meet with others in the course to exchange notes and study from each other's notes.", "Take detailed notes. Go to lectures. Record the lectures.", "Take good notes!", "Take good notes! Everything on the test is from them.", "Take good notes, attend all lectures.", "Take good notes--exams will be heavy on facts jotted down in lectures", "Take if interested. Material is interesting, low workload, tests are reasonable", "Take it if Graziano's teaching. He's a fun guy, and you'll learn a lot, painlessly (especially if you PDF). You really should PDF if you can, especially if you don't do well on the first midterm.", "Take it if it's required for you.", "Take it if you are at all interested in Neuroscience.", "Take it if you think you are interested in neuro, which you probably are. Its not sexy or super interesting unless you are passionate, but its not a bad class", "Take it if you're even vaguely interesting in neuro. However, make sure you go to lecture.", "Take it if you're interested in neuroscience.", "Take it! Awesome course, whether you're majoring in NEU or not :)", "Take it! But make sure to go to lectures - this is where you learn.  The book will not suffice.", "Take it! Even if you're not interested in the sciences this class is captivating and the workload is almost nonexistent so you can focus on absorbing the interesting material.", "Take it! The lectures are accessible and fascinating and totally worthwhile.", "Take it!!! Do not bother buying the textbook, but always go to lectures.", "Take it, if you can take good notes yourself and don't really need to be walked thru stuff and are just interested in Neuro. Don't take it if you can't stand confusing lectures.", "Take it.", "Take it. Amazing", "Take it. There is little work and its interesting.", "Take notes!", "Take this class GRAZIANO is amazing", "Take this class because you will not regret it! The topic material is interesting, the professor is great, and the structure of the course is such that it is not burdensome to students!", "Take this class if the material covered interests you. A lot of memorization but lectures are interesting .", "Take this class only if you have to.", "Take this course especially if you're interested in learning about how the brain receives and deal with information. Lectures are very good, but require very detailed note-taking. A good course to PDF.", "Take this course if you are interested in neuroscience. It is a great introductory course and you learn a lot. Make sure to attend all the lectures.", "Take this course if you're interested in neuroscience, and try to figure out beforehand if you are so you don't lose interest halfway through all the material.", "Take this if you have a general interest in neuro or psych. It is interesting, the professor is great and funny and the tests are refreshingly straightforward.", "Take! It's cool!", "Textbook readings aren't necessary. Tests are based entirely on lectures. For that reason I found it helpful to record each lecture.", "The class is super interesting, Graziano was wonderful and the head preceptor Taylor Webb was a great complement. The class is hard to succeed in because the grades tend to all be in the same area, so they're stratified imo with trick questions or super minute differences. If you need a good grade, I wouldn't count on it. You can know everything and not end up with a good grade.", "The readings DO help. GO TO ALL LECTURES!", "This class is phenominal. So much fun and so interesting. If you're looking for the perfect STN to PDF this is the one. There's no work outside of class other than studying for four, non-cumulative multiple-choice exams, the professor is EPIC and the preceptors are all really great and committed. Neuroscience is so COOL!!! (And this is coming from a humanist!)", "This course is interesting, but you must go to every lecture if you want to learn the information.", "This is a good class to take to full fill a STN. There is barely any reading or tests. I suggest reading the textbook if you want a particularly good grade.", "This is a very relaxing but yet also fascinating class. I recommend it for anyone interested in the science department or for  anyone wanting a less stressful class.", "This is a very stimulating and informative class, I highly recommend it to other students. My advice would be to make sure to attend all lectures, it is vital for the exams.", "This is an extremely interesting course. It is not a huge time commitment, but you have to  go to every lecture and take good notes in order to do well on the exams. It was nice that the semester's information was broken up into 4 exams that were not cumulative.", "This is an interesting introduction to the topic. The workload is just exams based off the lectures so it is excellent for those wishing to take a course P/D/F.", "Um don't take this just for an easy STN. There's way too many premeds.", "Very chill class. GO TO LECTURE and then study for tests and you will be fine.", "Very interesting class, just make sure to attend every lecture", "Very interesting course, straightforward, excellent lectures by Professor Graziano.", "Worth taking.", "Yes! Interesting!

Though I learned a great deal, COS 126 was a huge time-suck for me, and didn't allow me to focus on my other courses. If you have no experience, this class isn't made for you. It moves at an extremely fast pace, and everything is cumulative, so if you don't understand one topic, you are hurting yourself for the remainder of the semester. \nIn my experience, I have found that newbies either hate it or love it.

If you don?t make ure you use all the resources available to help you and the class should go by fine.", "If you read the assignment and the checklist all the way through, they practically walk you through what you have to do, so finishing the programs will take at most a few hours per week. Read the assignments early so that you absorb the advice preceptors give. I came in with a bare-basic introduction to programming (print statements and loops but not arrays and methods) and this course was a very low time commitment.

Lab instructor (Norman Jarosik) is really friendly and does all he can to make sure you succeed and understand the content. You also learn to solder, use MATLAB, and format your technical documents in a program called LaTeX which is really useful for higher-level classes. Demos are interesting and fun to watch. Vikram (the professor), holds a lot of office hours so you can always ask him questions. Because you would be taking this class with EGR 192 at the same time, the professors are more willing to change due dates of assignments around (and reschedule review/problem sessions) when they conflict with each other since everyone will have the same schedule conflict. You would definitely not have this conveniency in regular MAT 201 and PHY 103\n\nCons: While interesting, demos don't really contribute too much to really learning the details of the concepts you need to know to do the problem sets. Instruction during precept and lecture is not always very helpful to complete problem sets. Expect to rely on reading the textbook for the details of each general concept Vikram introduces in class (but, from experience, this seems to be true for most classes, not just physics). Other than a few lessons that overlap with EGR 192, there isn't much connection between the two classes (which is what I expected). \n\nIn general, I would do EMP and take this PHY class over regular PHY 103 because you get to know the people in EMP a lot better and from what I hear, the instruction in PHY 103 isn't much better.

He's amazingly good at demystifying topics, and watching him lecture was like watching MTT conduct the SF Symphony in Mahler.

If there are seminars that get glowing reviews, I might choose them over this one, but if you are traveling to New Orleans, planning on spending time there, etc. this class provides invaluable augmentation to one's experience of the city, giving a deeper layer of meaning to experiences there. Overall, the course was okay. In the end, I'm glad I took it, but it frustrated me throughout the semester - mostly because of the work distribution (and therefore grading distribution), the slow pace of the seminar time itself, and the lack of a directly cohesive narrative that we were exploring. From what I've heard, Guild is great in lectures - perhaps consider that instead? You can't necessarily go wrong with this class, but do consider other options.

I think if you are thinking about whether to take this class, you are probably trying to decide between taking EMP or not. While I think the physics portion of EMP is much better than the math, it is worth taking the math class so that you can have the great experience from physics too. While the instruction was not great (i.e. I had to look most stuff up in the book which was pretty clear if you took the time to read it), the professors host problem sessions every week before the problem set which is really great to not only get your problem set done (because frankly, the students are sometimes better at explaining the content than the professors) but also make friends! And from what I have heard from people in regular MAT 201, the instruction is no better and the tests are harder...of course this may not necessarily be the case next year. Another benefit in taking this course is the added flexibility of the professors because it is taken jointly with physics. One time, we had a big take-home quiz in math due the next day as well as a physics pset due the same day so Vikram Duvvuri, our physics professor, pushed the deadline for our physics problem set back a day so we could all focus on the math quiz. Of course, if you were not in EMP and just took MAT 201 and PHYS 103, you would not have this type of flexibility.

There's a good balance between writing theoretical proofs and doing computational exercises in MATLAB. The course is NOT the same as ORF 307 at all - I believe 307 spends all its time on linear programming. For this reason, I think 363 is a better course for learning about optimization in general. MAT 203-204 definitely helps, 309 is pretty much irrelevant, and a working knowledge of MATLAB is essential.

There are plenty of projects to keep up with, and the most important thing is to manage your time wisely. With regards to the difficulty of the material, it is paramount to do practice problems and sometimes even the pset more than once. If you find yourself not understanding something, it is extremely important to go learn it! Do not let yourself fall behind - do practice problems from the book (answers are provided), do the Pset problems 2 or 3 times using different techniques (I.E. do a problem using node analysis, then do it using mesh current analysis, then do it using circuit reduction), etc. Perhaps the biggest reason for poor performance is doing only the bare minimum - understanding the material cannot be attained from only doing the lectures, classes, psets, and projects. You must be proactive and work at it until reducing circuits is as natural as adding a pair of two-digit numbers. \n\nThe following courses are helpful, but not necessary to have under your belt: single-variable calculus, linear algebra, E&M physics (Including sinusoidal steady-state analysis using phasors, the e^iomega thing). Things from these subjects pop up once in a while, and having taken these classes beforehand saves you from having to learn them on the fly.\n\nIf you are not an ELE major, the only caution I have for you is the workload. This class does require a lot of work, just like ELE 206 does. It is nevertheless a very fun and rewarding experience, and most ELE majors can take 5 courses with this included, and do just fine in them.

The class has alot of huger projects in addition to the normal class/lab/precept requirement.

Having taken coursework in early Christianity I was very disappointed by this class. The analysis of the canonical gospels that was presented was minimal or absent. It usually went something like \"Mark uses this word and Luke uses this word--how inconsistent! Let's move on.\" The dating of the texts were not discussed at all, dates were just assigned and questions as to where the dates came from were not answered. \n\nThe canonization process was oversimplified and often misrepresented in lecture. Pagels seemed to think that certain Church Fathers were singularly responsible for the acceptance or rejection of certain texts, in spite of them having no legitimate means of exercising power over the church. The use of specific gospel traditions in the works of the apostolic fathers was not discussed. \n\nPagels frequently pointed out the biases of certain scholars (Schweitzer, for example) but seemed very comfortable ignoring her own. I was surprised by the derision with witch she spoke about the role of women expressed in several canonical texts. By all means she can disagree with them, but making passive aggressive statements about them sounded childish. \n\nSome of the paper topics were ridiculous. \"Imagine you are making a movie about early Christianity\" began one of them. I felt like I was in middle school again. Don't take this class, it is a waste of time. Just buy one of Pagels's books instead.", "This course is a GREAT way to discover early Christianity.

However, the info pairs nicely with some of the topics in lecture, and you'll find that the content from one helps clarify the ideas in the other, and vice versa. The class was structured this semester around \"debates\" (historic vs. innovative, tectonic vs. representative,etc). which you'll spend a few lectures on before having to write an assignment on your thoughts. Stan called these \"position papers,\" which can be a little misleading since some debates are hard to really take a stance on because the two sides often don't oppose perfectly. Generally, my advice would be to just watch your time with those assignments, especially in the 2nd half of the semester when they are closely spaced (about one every other week; there are 5 in the term in total). They're only meant to be about 300 words, but you'll probably go over that and will also have to include photos to support your ideas, so they take time. Ultimately, you probably have to be a little less concrete of a thinker and be open to a more interpretative and abstract course.

I would enthusiastically recommend this course to anyone who thinks that doing stuff with numbers can be fun.  So what makes ORF 309 so great?\n\n1.  It's useful.  I'm a junior in the COS department, and I took this course because I wanted to understand machine learning.  I had taken COS 424 (machine learning) the previous spring, and had felt embarrassed that I couldn't follow many of the proofs that required manipulating probability distributions.  It's one thing to be *acquainted* with the laws of probability, but it's another thing to really feel them in your bones.  ORF 309 makes you fluent in probability.\n\nAlso, if you're interested in a job in quantitative finance (or at least want to leave the option open) this course would come in handy for interviews.  \n\n2.  It's entertaining.  Probability questions are just really, really fun to solve.\n\n3.  It's not that hard.  Ramon van Handel is an incredible teacher and a gifted explainer.  He makes probability easy.  Coming into this course, I was uneasy, because I had often heard ORF 309 compared to COS 340, which was for sure a hard class.  This is not a good comparison.  ORF 309 is much easier.  If you put in the effort (go to office hours, collaborate with a group), there's no reason why you can't get every homework question right.  And the exams generally have straightforward questions.\n\nAll around, this was an amazing course.", "The course is difficult.

Apart from that, general knowledge on all of the sciences helps a lot. This class focuses on mathematical models and quantitative descriptions of natural phenomena, and not on the fundamental concepts of the sciences themselves. You will learned applied math to physics, biology, and some chemistry, not the subjects themselves. Be prepared for heavy workloads and self-learning on some unclear topics. Lab reports are intense, too, but awesome learning experiences.", "Be prepared for school work unlike any you have ever seen before.", "Beware.", "Definitely learned a lot in this class, from both the lecture component and the lab component. But I would recommend with reservation, according to your own plan of study. Sometimes you will definitely feel the time you spent on something is not worth it, sometimes things are not well connected or reasonably well addressed, and a lot of the material you might need for your major (i.e. physics and chem) is not covered. My general feeling is that ISC ultimately serves molbio because its mission is to connect biological sciences with physical sciences, and if you are a molbio major this is definitely the best program for you. But if you are a physics major or a chem major, not everything you need to know is covered and sometimes your effort is wasted when the course is not structured so well or the material is not connected so well. For example, I like physics much more than all the others, and I think the physics in ISC is not enough and not comparable to that in 105-106. I would have taken MAT215 and PHY105 instead of ISC if I were to start freshman year all over again, because now I know I like physics. But I still love ISC and learned a lot and the holistic experience is still worth it. Not as intimidating as you might have heard. If you don't know what you want to major in you can give it a try, but if you know you are more inclined to math and physics (actually I know before freshman year), I would not highly recommend ISC. Take MAT215 with PHY105.", "Do not take it unless you are sure you want to.

They are not exaggerating. ISC is probably the hardest course you can take freshman year. I'm not sure if it's worth it for everyone. It was worth it for me, but I struggled very much to get through it. That been said, it's extremely interesting and very very cool, which is why students keep taking it. I would suggest taking it, but only if you'd feel comfortable dropping out if it became too hard for you.", "Get ready to spend the majority, if not all, of your time in this class.", "Have a strong physics background.", "In the hours before the final problem set was due, I was camping out in Icahn with some classmates, trying to finish the assignment. It was hard. Frustrating. I scribbled down some integrals, but I wasn't really sure what was going on. The person beside me was rushing to wrap up a particularly long question. \"I can't wait to be done with this problem set,\" someone said. We grumbled in unison and rhetorically wondered aloud why we signed up for this class in the first place. Would have had so much more free time. Would have spared ourselves for so much agony. Someone asked, \"yo, are you all doing ISC next semester?\" There was a short pause as we stared at each other, but the answer was a unanimous yes. We giggled at ourselves, (sorta) finished the problem set, and walked out to a beautiful December evening.\n\nThe thing about ISC is that although it is difficult and time-consuming, what we've been learning is just so fascinating it draws us in for another semester. The people in it - classmates, instructors, TAs, ISC alumni - also contributes to why I enjoy the class. I learned a lot this semester, but any bit of arrogance I had walking in was neatly shattered. \n\nIf this sounds a freshman year you would appreciate, give ISC a shot. Come in with a strong background in relevant skills - calculus, physics, MATLAB, java, group work - and your life will be easier. Try it out anyway even if you don't but don't be afraid to drop. Recommended with great caution.", "It is more work than you can imagine. You think you can handle it, but you probably can't. Your GPA in other classes will suffer greatly. Everyone has wanted to dropp the course multiple times, even after dropp/add ends. You don't really find out what you're getting into until three weeks before the midterm. When it's 2AM in Icahn on a Thursday, you'll hate life, but at least there will be 20 other people hating life with you.\n\nThis course is a rollercoaster. It will provide some of the greatest lows in your Princeton experience: I remember one post-pset dinner where a student sat down and said \"Fuck ISC.\" Everyone agreed.\n\nOn the other hand, it will also provide some of the greatest highs in your Princeton experience: understanding what statistical mechanics is all about, realizing you can actually model a real-world system, and many more.\n\nIf you take this course, you will be sacrificing 1) your GPA in other courses, 2) your quality of life (sleep, food, etc.), 3) your ability to participate in extracurriculars. I'm still not sure if that was worth the benefits for me. Only you can decide that for yourself.", "Not sure I can really describe the nature of the course in the time I have right now.

I repeat, have fun!", "Stay on top of stuff", "Take it but beware of the course load. Don't be discouraged by the difficult first few weeks. It gets better!", "The absolute only way I would recommend this would be if you're a possible physics major with AP bio/chem/physics. ISC is worth it only if you already know the concepts and are willing to spend a year working like crazy for physics and killing your social life. Not worth it. This is the point in life when giving up is not actually giving up, but a very admirable and sane option.", "The class is very time consuming and very difficult. There is a lot to be learned but it requires dedication. I would ask former students and really consider if you want to have be so dedicated to one class. Make sure you have a solid math foundation.", "The rumors about this course are all TRUE. This course will suck away your social life and opportunities for activities outside of ISC for a solid year, but the rewards are worth it: everyone becomes very tight, you learn skills that are unmatched in other equivalent courses, everything is LaTeXed, and it is a valuable pathway into a variety of other disciplines. In the end, the choice is up to you, but feel free to ask us if you have questions.", "Think very hard about how hard you want to work your first semester and how good your math preparation is. If you are interested in quantitative bio and are ready to devote your first year to science, then in that case I recommend it fully!", "This course is a lot of physics (and therefore a lot of math), with quantitative applications in biology (and a bit in chemistry). Try your best to start the problems sets early in the week when they're first announced so that you can actually ask the TA's questions during the Wednesday night problem sessions or go to their office hours for clarification (which you'll almost definitely need on some of the material). Also, try your very hardest (though it doesn't usually work) to not leave lab reports to the weekend before they are do; if you do this (as I often ended up doing), your weekend will be miserable and you will get very little sleep. Perhaps the material will come more easily to you / you'll be faster at working through the problem sets than I was; otherwise, you probably won't be getting a lot of sleep. Despite the heavy workload, some of the professors are wonderful, the material is generally fascinating, and you'll form strong bonds with your other classmates. Don't be afraid at the start to work together with your classmates!! And know that there ARE resources (TA's, professors, office hours, peer tutors, etc.) to help you if you are having trouble with the material; that being said, it can often be difficult to arrange your time suitably in order to take full advantage of these resources. Also, you really have to be invested and committed to take this course, as you WILL end up having to devote the majority of your academic time and efforts to it (so don't just decide to take it on a whim). On the whole, though, I feel as though this course has given me a much better understanding of what science and scientific inquiry actually involve, and has changed the way I approach scientific problem solving. Oh, and the labs are fantastic (and while the lab reports can be a pain, at least you feel as though you are doing something legitimately worthwhile and are learning clear skills by doing so)!", "This course is extremely difficult and will take almost all of your time. That said, it is also extremely rewarding and has been one of the best academic experiences I have ever had. If you are prepared to commit to the course, it will be amazing, but if not, it will probably be impossible.", "This course is just as demanding if not more demanding than what people say. It was definitely far more time consuming than I expected. However, the course did indeed achieve its expressed purpose of changing my perspective on science. The class really is integrated rather than multidisciplinary, and it felt as though they taught us how to think scientifically more than just content. I found this method of teaching to be particularly intelligent since learning content can be done without too much difficulty on one's own time but having one's perspective on an entire field that many of us identify with is a more rare and valuable opportunity this course provides. Very little memorization is required and what we do end up remembering is due to it coming up repeated during the course rather than deliberate rote memorization. The course content is developed very mathematically and model-orientated rather than fact or observation orientated. It definitely is a class that teaches us how to think like a scientist in that they show us the thought process behind derivations and models, and the lab portion of the course demands us write quite professional looking lab reports and give good guidance on how to do so. As a warning, the class demands a ton of work but the grading seems to be fair. I highly recommend the course for anyone interested in either becoming a scientist or learning how to think scientifically.", "This course is more work than you can imagine. That being said, taking ISC was the best decision I could have made during the beginning of my freshman year. I am so privileged to have such a talented group of classmates, and truly believe that I could not have been a part of such a great scientific community in the equivalent introductory science courses offered at Princeton.", "To get the most out of this class you should already have a solid background in all of the sciences (AP Biology, Chemistry, and Physics C).

If you are not a humanities major, also good for fulfilling distribution requirements - but you should still be interested or else the readings will be tough.", "HUM is impossible and amazing and beautiful and frustrating and rewarding. Read as much as you can, but don't sweat skimming--it's inevitable. It's going to suck, and you'll hate it, but you'll also love it in some sick way. Make sure you really stay on one passage for the papers-- they will give you c's. Not reading won't really catch up to you until the final, so be consistent in at least reading some of all the books. The best part of the course will really happen outside of it-- the community you build and all the awesome lunch/late meal/late-night discussions you'll have with fellow HUMies. Take the course. You'll regret it, and yet you really won't be able to stay away.", "I found these reviews very helpful when I was picking courses so I will give here a lengthier review. HUM is slightly less challenging than what many of us expected. In fact, this course is indeed \"what you want out of it\" in that you really do have quite a bit of leeway in regards to how you spend your time doing the work, thereby making the tremendous amount of reading more manageable and interesting. For example, if you are particularly interested in philosophy, you can speed read the history and literature to get the flavor of the author and text but then slow down and digest all the philosophy, then write all of your essays on philosophy, spend time talking to the philosophy professors, etc. Thus if you're interested in either history, literature, or philosophy (or some combination but not necessarily but potentially all) then I highly recommend HUM. The course truly is about the books with the lectures, precepts, and essays as supplementary so if you have the discipline perhaps this course isn't absolutely necessary since one could simply read all the books but having the structured course and guidance was valuable. One particular benefit from reading the books in HUM I didn't realize going in was that every time we read a text by some author, we have by that point already read many of the texts that the author himself read which gave great context to understanding the text but also was enjoyable since we were following an incredible intellectual journey of western thought. Fair warning though, it seems that HUM gives out lower grades than what one would hope for, so I must say, having the perspective of taking HUM to change your view on things and introduce you to new ideas and personal improvement is definitely healthier and less stressful than focusing on grades. Highly recommended nevertheless!", "I would recommend against taking this course. You read a lot of great works, but you may have to wade through things you're less interested in. The lectures are good but at ONE LECTURE A BOOK you won't get much out of it.", "If you are a humanities lover, take it!! And if you don't feel ready as a freshman, do it as a  sophomore. After being super on-the-fence, I finally decided to take the class and am so glad I did. The readings are amazing and thought-provoking, and in an ideal world, every educated person would be familiar with them. The lectures are excellent, with top-notch professors who also provide insight into pedagogical differences as they each handle the texts in their own ways. The precepts are really special, with a much higher level of student engagement than in other courses I've taken here, and it's easy to make HUM friends both inside and outside the classroom. The papers are hard to write, but practicing them definitely helps you improve your essay-writing abilities in general, and the workload of the course is manageable (much more manageable than people make it out to be--don't be scared!). HUM feels like a bigger experience, something more than a class, and you get to delve into the texts to a substantial degree despite the survey nature of the course. Advice for when you take HUM: Don't fall behind on readings by more than a couple of days, or you will lose motivation to catch up and get swamped. If you can, set aside time so that you finish the reading for a particular lecture one day before that lecture, leaving yourself a little buffer room for unforeseen interruptions to your reading schedule. And definitely do as much of the readings as you can! This course revolves around the texts, and I think personally engaging with the books is key to fully enjoying lectures and precepts.", "If you are considering a major in Classics, Comp Lit, English, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Sociology, or History (like me!), this is a must-take, as it covers (broadly) all of Western Civilization for the last few thousand years. You should also take it if you want to be a well-read, knowledgeable person in general. Some students may complain about the workload, but I tell you, it is well worth it. You will almost certainly never read this much, and this well, on your own.", "If you are considering this course, you should take it if possible. Be prepared for a lot of reading, but other than that there is not much work.", "If you are even remotely considering taking the HUM Sequence, you absolutely must do it. I know many students who regret not taking HUM, whereas no one in HUM regrets having taken it. This is a once in a lifetime educational opportunity to learn from some of Princeton's best professors about incredible works that form the foundation of so many other disciplines. Suggestions are to be sure you do the summer reading, plan a consistent reading schedule (you get much more out of the class if you do the readings before lecture), utilize the Writing Center and your grader's office hours for the papers, and to come to precepts with prepared quotes you'd like to discuss. Just be on top of your game and be efficient with your time and you'll be fine. Remember this is a double class, so while it may seem like an insane amount of work, it is very doable if you are focused and committed.", "It is a lot of work and you will spend a lot of time reading, especially if you do all of the reading.

Don't cheat yourself by skimping on the effort you can put in.

Enjoy the course for the experience, don't stress too much over the grades. Your enthusiasm and effort are the best things you can bring to the course; even if you have little to no experience in the literature or fields of study of this course (like I didn't), I am certain you will still enjoy the course immensely and perform well as well.", "Only take this class if you are interested in the subject matter and believe that you have the time to read and think about most of the works.

I made such wonderful friends - the HUM community is very close-knit - and met such wonderful professors that I probably wouldn't have come into contact with otherwise. The reading is certainly manageable if you don't let it pile up week after week, and the books are so iconic and interesting that it isn't too difficult to push through it. The one thing I wish I had done more of is go to more office hours, because the professors are really approachable, helpful, and knowledgeable.

The professors and lectures are great and it's a really special way to start your academic career at Princeton.", "The course is intensive, but not undoable. 400 pages a week sounds daunting at first, but you get used to it rather quickly. That HUM is a double course also makes up for this. Definitely not unmanageable with an otherwise normal schedule, just be sure you really have the drive to commit to these works - i.e. fundamental texts of the Western Canon. The course moves very quickly, so it's easy to get behind. Don't necessarily expect to fully understand all any of the works have to offer from this course. HUM is more of a tasty platter of hors d'oeuvres than it is a series of entrees. You will get a thorough introduction to each work on the syllabus, which for me only increased my desire to revisit them later.", "This class is not meant to closely analyze every work that you are assigned to read.

You don't need BC calculus or even AB (although they are helpful in providing intuition) because mathematics here is literally proved from the bottom up. This is probably my favorite class this semester, but it's not a course for the weak. I recall one girl who said that one of the reasons she's taking this is for the knowledge gained at the end and the ability to say \"I survived MAT 215.\" This class consumes you, but at the end, what emerges is a new you with a different way of thinking, and I think that is completely worth it.", "It's a great intro to proof-based math.", "Keep up with the work. Do your psets. Don't rely on others.", "Look. You know if you should take this class or not. Have you been going to bath camp since 2nd grade? Did you take calculus in middle school? If so, you're with the clear majority of the class.\n\nDid you follow a normal high school track, get As in honors math classes, but didn't necessarily go home and read university level papers for fun? Probably shouldn't take this class.", "MAT 215 changed after they split MAT 216 into a completely different course. Don't be fooled, it is still a tough course. If you want to do well, expect to put in 12 hours a week at least, between homework and learning the material. I say take the course. Also, the first few problem sets can be a shock to the system. Then it becomes a personal choice, either hang with it or decide it's not for you. You really won't be able to make that decision until after you'd gone through the first two weeks, so shop it at least.", "MAT 215 was definitely different this semester than in years past. Professor Chang used Apostol instead of Rudin, so I feel like the course lost some of its character - we skipped over all of the topology stuff at the beginning (no metric spaces or Heine-Borel) that I believe is still covered in 216. (This may have been intended when they formally split 215's \"fast track\" into a separate course - I don't know.) As a result, the course was basically returning to AP Calculus BC and proving everything rigorously - not bad, just different. The textbook is more verbose than Rudin, which may be good or bad depending on your personal preference. Professor Chang's lectures are slow but informative, though people seemed to prefer McConnell. Go to the problem sessions for help on problem sets. Hope that you won't have to do massive long division to evaluate a Taylor series by hand on a problem set (this happened). The midterm was reasonable. As a sophomore taking the class after having taken 203-204 freshman year (econ major considering grad school), I might have had a slight edge in the beginning from having experience with proofs, but freshman math majors are smart cookies and the playing field quickly evened out. If you're choosing between 215 and 216, know that 215 is rigorous calculus and that 216 is the Rudin-level course with basic topology. If you're a sophomore, take either to build character and rigorous thinking ability. (Also a good QR requirement if anybody needs one.)", "Read as slowly as you have to until you understand perfectly. Go to office hours and review sessions. Never fall behind.", "Start the problem set and reading on the night it is released. Go to office hours, the review sessions with UCA's were unhelpful for me. Take good notes and go to each class. Find resources online as this class moves fast (especially Epsilon Delta proofs) know how to \"prove it\" and how to calculate. You'll survive. Oh, and TAKE CLASS WITH MCCONNELL, HE IS THE BEST. Do NOT TAKE CLASS WITH CHANG. BIG NO NO.", "Take it if you are interested in math completely different than regular high school math.", "Take it!", "Take the course if you think you would like doing rigorous mathematics. If you have had proof-writing experience in the past, it is best that you take 216, for your own sake.", "Take this class if you are really interested in mathematics. However, do keep in mind that this class takes a lot of time.", "Take this course", "Take this if you are interested in math, feel you are very good at it/have interest, but don't have as much experience with proofs. Even if you do have experience with proofs, it is challenging, and most certainly worth taking. Professor McConnell is an EXTREMELY good teacher, and was very popular with all of us, so if he is teaching it, that is a BIG extra reason to sign up! But only take this if you are genuinely interested in math; you will regret it if you aren't. It's a wonderful course overall!", "The course is very hard.  Very, very difficult.\nThe homework is a bit tedious.\nIf McConnell is your teacher, you are in for a treat.", "This is a demanding class. Try to completely understand each and every problem of the homework. Go to office hours.", "This is a great course if you are looking to extend your knowledge of calculus into a more rigorous setting. For those who have no proof-based mathematics experience, this course is somewhat of a jump at the beginning. For those with some proof-based math experience, this course fits well. For those with much proof-based experience and experience at national and international mathematics competitions, you would probably be more engaged by the accelerated version (MAT 216) of this course.", "What could I possibly say? If you're interested in math as a major, take this course. If you're even considering it, take this course. Even if you don't like math that much, take this course. In general, take this course. I had no (I mean, literally 0) experience with proofs before this course. And yet, the impeccable lectures and great textbook gave them a beauty I had never seen before. That being said, be prepared to work. And I mean, a LOT, especially in the first few weeks. These problem sets are not for the faint-hearted. But, if you make it through, you will, in no way, regret your decision. This is, for practically everyone, an absolute must-take class.", "You can take this class even if you're not interested in a math major/minor, but you have to keep up with the effort of the math majors to survive the curve. Be prepared for at least 15-20 hours per problem set. If you want to do better than average, start the problem sets early in the week and go out of your way to ask for help when you're stuck.

Niels is a great guy and makes the class more engaging / interesting (because, to be honest, real analysis probably isn't the most exciting math class you can take). Stein's book is good but it's pretty dense and not easy to digest mathematically (in fact some of the homework problems were rewriting and completing some of the proofs in the book so that they make sense). The class may be a bit uneven in the way we cover the book; for example, up until midterm week we were working on Chapter 1 and did a tiny bit of 2, then during the next couple of weeks we went over Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 and for the rest of the semester we worked on Chapter 4 (Hilbert spaces & Fourier series).

His transparency about the difficulties of his teaching/our taking the course (the oxymoron of teaching one how to do independent work, how to multitask the exploration of a text and research methods, etc.) was an extremely smart way to handle it; rather than feel infantilized or overwhelmed I felt my classmates and I stepped up to face these challenges alongside him and see how much we could collectively glean from the process.

I took this class because Smith gave a talk at my eating club's roundtable. The question of where our morals come from fascinated me, and so I decided to take this over Ethics & Public Policy. SMITH WAS A FANTASTIC LECTURER. Every lecture was incredibly stimulating, lecture handouts were amazing, and I learned so much more than I ever could have gotten out of from reading on my own. Profs like Smith are why I'm going to miss Princeton so much. Get Smith for your preceptor, too, whichever course he teaches.

In fact, I think he probably would have seemed much better if he wasn't constantly being compared to Smith. Lectures were slightly dry, and mostly just summaries of the readings. Since applied ethics is not a very complex field, this made lecture somewhat useless if you had done the readings (unlike metaethics, where you could do the readings and still not understand them).", "LOVED this class.

Sebastian is not.", "N/A", "None", "Only take this course if Michael Smith teaches the whole thing; he is a great lecturer and very engaging.", "Only take this course if you need it is required by a certificate/major you're pursuing!", "Please take it, especially if Michael Smith is teaching!

You should do the readings, or at least skim them.", "Readings can be very long and I wouldn't say they were all necessary if you attend lecture. If anything, skim for the main idea, attend lectures, and everything should work out fine. Be an active participant in class because otherwise, precepts can be a nightmare.", "Really engage in precepts because that is where you will be able to better deconstruct arguments presented. Consult with preceptors ahead of time about philosophy paper format and writing if you haven't written a philosophy paper before as they have helpful insight.", "Recommend, unless you're super against pondering the meaning of life/things of that sort because then you'll feel like going to lecture is a waste of time.

I took this as a senior and I only WISH I took it sooner because I probably would have become a philosophy major. I absolutely loved how the course molds you to be a better thinker and formulate your arguments more succinctly. Smith's lectures are amazing - he has a conversation with the class, doesn't just talk at us. He pauses for questions, gives us time to think, and doesn't go by powerpoint slides. He also gives us a handout which is super useful - that way you can just listen to what he's saying instead of worrying about writing every word down. The co-prof, Kohler, reads off the slides which made them a little boring but useful if you can't make it to class. I had precept with Ali and it was just one big debate every week and I LOVED IT.", "Take Intro to Moral if you want a class that is easy to PDF, have good writing skills and want an easy A, or actually like Philosophy.

Also the test at the end is a joke that you could just review the handouts to be prepared for.", "The course is a strong survey of normative ethics. I suggest taking before 307.", "The course is challenging at times, but extremely interesting.

Easy B, definitely worth taking.", "There are other better philosophy courses.", "This class is very introductory, so its information is pretty good, but somewhat surface-level compared to other philosophy classes.", "This course is a good EM. It is not too difficult and it is very interesting. Professor Smith is a great professor (and Professor Kohler is kind of boring but very clear which is great for philosophy). Ali Fatollahi is also a great preceptor. If you want to really learn something, you should have an interest in morals and ethics. The class spans from if morals even exist to practical ethics )like abortion, euthanasia and more) so it's a lot of interesting material. However, you can do well without that but it wouldn't be a fun class for you.", "This is a good class to take if you are trying to fulfill a distributional requirement or just want to see what a philosophy class is like.", "This is a great course for anyone slightly interested in moral philosophy who wants a fun, manageable course. There are not many assignments, and the reading load is light (but don't try to read philosophy when you're exhausted, because it won't make any sense!).

But after taking this course, and having Dondero as a preceptor, I definitely feel like it was much better than what most people say. Some of the assignments may seem overwhelming, but the latter ones are pretty straightforward. Personally, I liked learning the lower level languages and really understanding how abstract concepts actually get executed. If possible, get started on assignments early and try to get Dondero if he's precepting. Otherwise, follow the suggestions on the assignment page and post questions on Piazza.", "Of course, it's a COS departmental, so COS majors have to take it.

This course is exciting, challenging, stimulating, and once you're done, you really feel like you've learned a lot. \nOn the other hand, this course is incredibly difficult and does drain a lot of time. It's not unfair in its time drain, but it's still a drain. If you like computer science, you're interested in pursuing further studies in computer science, if you want to have any kind of relationship to computer science further than its a thing that I know exists, this class is strongly recommended.

Assignments are mostly instructional and don?t allow for much creativity until the final assignment. Find a good preceptor who knows what he/she is teaching, because you?ll find it much easier if you can get the concepts in precept rather than on your own.

If you're working on it before the last relevant precept and you get stuck, wait until that precept because often major questions you have will be answered in upcoming relevant precepts.", "Take 217! If Dondero lectures again, then you owe it to yourself to take this class. The lecture slides are excellent when combined with the required reading. If you end up with Dondero as a preceptor as well, then you'll do very well on all your assignments. The assignments take about 2-2.5 days on average (with your other classes included) so it's best to do them as soon as possible. If you get really, really stuck, you can send him the code and he'll go out of his way and annotate it for you like an English paper! I mean who does that?? Overall, the course is very well-organized so I highly recommend it!", "Take it if it have to only because it's a lot of work. Still, it is very well designed and taught.", "Take it if you are interested in computer systems and aren't taking a brutal schedule already. The assignments are tough and make you want to pull your hair out sometime, but making a bash shell in the final assignment is unbelievably rewarding.

Dondero is amazing and truly cares about his students. He loves teaching. If you're a COS major, you have to take it, but it's such an important class to learn how a computer functions. It's a ton of work, so if you don't have to take it and want a light schedule, COS 217 is not for you. Nonetheless, if you have any interest in computer systems, you'll have a great time.

Take this class and die.", "Very hard class, but quite interesting overall. Take it, but make it your hardest class in a given semester.", "We had Dondero as lecturer. It's a great class, and effort is rewarded. That means, go to lecture, be awake during lecture, do the readings, go to office hours for debugging, and then ask questions.

Start simulations as soon as you can and get started early on the GAMS assignment.

Take breaks and stay sane. Embrace living in the Equad because if it isn't already, it's your home now. You've made it this far with CBE, you can do it.", "CBE 442 was not the worst experience of my life.\n\nDo not scoff! Do not roll your eyes! I do not jest! Like you, I have known loss, heartbreak, deceit, and disillusionment. In comparison, Design was trivial. A mere grain of sand added to the pile of bricks on my heart.\n\nHowever.\n\nHowever? but no. I cannot begin there. For you to understand the impact of Design on my life, you must first understand me, at least a little. For how do we explain ourselves but through narrative?\n\nI came to Princeton, wide-eyed and eager, ready to dive into CBE, the major of my choice. I will not lie to you ? CBE is not an easy road. I watched many of my peers leave their CBE homeland for greener pastures and whiter shores. But as much as I enjoyed complaining about it, I thrived on the struggle. I thought Reactors was interesting. I enjoyed Core Lab! I didn?t expect senior year to be much different. I had read the reviews of Design ? who hasn?t? I knew what people said. But I also knew that CBE is a major populated with people who don?t really want to be here, who would rather be bioengineers or materials scientists or environmental engineers. I assumed they were the Design detractors. So I opened my mind and my heart to Design.\n\nThe first three or four weeks were easy. Easier, certainly, than Thermo was at the time. I thought I was safe. Even the first report, which caused me to set a new record for how late I stayed up, was pleasant in its way. Then came AspenPlus, and eight straight evenings spent in the Design Lab. Then I broke the staying-up-late record I had set just a few weeks before to finish the second report. Then came the third exam. Then the third report, on which my partners and I spent an estimated 200 hours over the first seven days of reading period.\n \nTo you CBE juniors, sophomores, and freshmen: thank your lucky sigmas that Professor Floudas will not be teaching Design next year, and pray to whatever gamma you worship that the next professor will look upon you with more pity and generosity.\n\nPros\n-\tCried three times ? very cleansing for my tear ducts!\n-\tI now realize that I am capable of surviving every mental and emotional hurdle I am likely to face in my professional career.\n-\tMy feeling that I am superior to students in almost every other major at this school has solidified into a certainty.\n\nCons\n-\tThe scars on my soul will never fade. \n\nLet me be serious now. Design is not a bad class, nor is its professor evil. Someday I might even be grateful for it, as we are grateful for any experience that strengthens us. But Design 2014-2015 made me suffer, when I did not want to suffer. I did not want the major I chose to punish me for my choice. To the CBE major in general: if you bite the hand that feeds you, you will not survive the lean winter. (To AIChE, the organization responsible in part: ditto. To Princeton: it?s time to make a Bioengineering major. And a Materials Science major. Your students are certainly paying enough.) To the next design professor: do not let the way things were dictate how they shall be.\n \nLogan Matthews, you deserve a shout-out for making this class six times more bearable. The state of New Jersey is sorry to see you go. The state of Texas, and the world, is lucky to have you.\n\nFuture Designers: CHOOSE A GOOD GROUP! My partners and I worked well together and had fun, and I love them all the more for all we accomplished together.\nOne last thing: I have long thought that Princeton students unreasonably think they are entitled to A?s, but to everyone who has turned out a halfway decent Design report and not failed the exams: Floudas may not have seen fit to give you an A on your transcript, but you are a winner.", "Choose your group members well! Make sure everyone works similarly--work ethic, the time in the day you work best, etc. Also, make sure you establish early on in the process what your expectations are for one another. This will definitely make it easier later on! Also, it can't be stressed enough how important it is to start the project EARLY! You will definitely run into computer issues that will take a lot longer than you think to resolve. Take advantage of the office hours. Try to enjoy the process because otherwise you will find it miserable--think positively!", "Don't take it unless you're a senior in CBE ... which means you're stuck anyway. Course requires too much effort for a semester (waay more than HUM sequence); On the project, TAs are instructed to give as little guidance as possible, which means they sometimes avoid answering your questions / don't give you complete answers... which can be annoying.", "Get started on all of the tasks early, and the TA's are super helpful. ASPEN is a pain, I felt like I built more character from it than brains.", "Hopefully, now that a new professor is teaching the course, it will be a bit easier. Regardless, be sure to start the design project early, and try to get partners with whom you get along really well, especially during prolonged periods of stress.", "I don't know what it will be like now that Floudas isn't teaching it anymore, but this year it was 4 exams and the project (only worth 35% of the grade). Some of the exams are fine but some are harder. Floudas never released past finals or assigned psets so you won't really know what to expect. Just take good lecture notes. For the project, make sure you have a good group above all. That can completely change your experience. Start early. Do not underestimate the amount of time this project takes. Make sure your other classes are chill. There were so many weeks this semester where we were in the design lab day and night. Aspen is inherently a bitch and GAMS is so annoying, but if you put in a good amount of time and effort, you will survive. Everyone survives in the end. To be honest, I enjoyed the work and course material more than some of the other CBE classes I've taken. The project can be pretty interesting, you will bond so much with your fellow CBEs, and it is satisfying to have accomplished it all. Just keep pushing through, and you'll be okay in the end.", "If you're CBE, be prepared to be very frustrated.", "Interesting, but way way way too much work. Just get through it", "It doesn't matter whether or not I recommend this course. You have to take it. It's super time consuming.", "It is a struggle, but it's worth it.", "Now that Floudas is gone, I am not sure how difficult the class will be. Important things are to get a group that has the same priorities and working schedule as you. Starting early is very important. Also, office hours will be super helpful, especially because the instructions are very general. And try to not waste away your fall semester on this class. The project is only a portion of the grade anyways.", "Oh my goodness where do I even begin. For the past three years you've been hearing older students talk about how hard design is...everything you imagine it to be, it's 10x worse. 4 exams AND a project, and half the project deadlines are the same day as an exam...it's brutal. It's absolutely brutal. Don't expect to have much of a life during this course, just get cozy in design lab (at least they've let sunlight back into the room now). But try to enjoy it. Enjoy your group partners, and enjoy the late nights because it's the last time ever you're going to be together with your entire CBE class doing the late nights all in one room. Bring food with you to the lab because you'll get hungry. But don't leave a mess because then you'll get an email from the department lecturing you about leaving the room messy during the \"occasional times you have to use design lab out of class hours\". \n\nI sincerely wish you the best of luck.", "Take really really good notes. Start early on projects.", "This course tests endurance more than smarts, as in expect to spend your entire week in the design room the week the report is due and to pull a few all-nighters throughout the semester. I would make sure to study well for the exams since they are worth a good chunk of your grade. I learned a lot, but that was to be expected given how much time I spent on this class. Also, make sure you choose group members who actually do work and whom you work well with, otherwise your life will be 10x as miserable.", "This course will probably be changing structurally, but if it does stay the same/is similar, here are some pointers. \n\n1. Have hope. This is the last required CBE class.\n2. But also, just to keep you grounded, here's a stress gauge. Think core lab is bad? Multiply that by 10 and you'll get the first report for design. The rest scales exponentially.\n3. Logistical stuff: Pick group members that have the same work ethic as you do. This may mean not working with your friends. Start early and go to office hours. Don't forget that you have other courses and don't forget that your group members have other courses. Don't have unrealistic expectations for your group members and don't get frustrated with them if you think they're not performing--they are trying their best too.", "Treat the workload for this course as the equivalent of 3 normal courses. Expect to spend a lot of time in the design lab working on each of the projects. Get started early, and don't be shy about going to office hours. You will learn a lot, and you will become a lot closer with your classmates.", "Well, good luck.", "Work on design all the time.", "You have no choice.

The first half of the course is learning various OR-type things, like economic order quantity, newsvendor problem, etc. Second half is all OJ game, plus lectures you probably will skip since they don't have much to do with the game. I think it's better if everyone on your team can at least understand what everyone else is doing. This way you can help each other out instead of sitting around wondering what to do next and you can interface the stuff you work on with everyone else's better. Inevitably though people carve out pieces of the project for themselves, and only they understand what their piece does. It's important to maintain a good team atmosphere - if your team starts doing poorly, try not to hate each other. Teams essentially maintain their original rankings. So put a lot of effort into the first year of business, because if you start behind you will never recover. Rankings change only when a team makes a serious mistake and falls behind--this is more likely to happen on OJ bowl day. So it's important to rehearse what you'll do that day, and if you decide to automate decision making and analysis procedures, check to make sure that your code is bug-free. Unfortunately there are no OJ bowl day practice runs. Many teams end up building a simulator of the actual OJ game simulator, and in fact the instructors suggest that you do so. Do so, and make good choices about what language to write it in, how to make it extensible so that it accommodates any parameters you throw at it. It's up to you how closely the simulator mimics the actual simulator. Closer is harder of course. The expressiveness of an actual programming language beats the heck out of Excel, but you will end up using a decent amount of Excel, especially since your decisions and results come in Excel files. So learn to interface programming languages with Excel.", "A very fun and interesting course.", "Be prepared to invest a lot of time in the OJ game.
