I expect MAE 332 Aircraft Design will show that it wasn't a mistake.  Here is my review, so you know what to expect.\nLectures constitute a gross abuse of PowerPoint.  It is clear the Prof. Stengel spent significant time on them, but they are ultimately not very useful.  This parallels the assignments for this class well; time consuming, but worthless.  Lectures present a lot of material, but do very little to help the students develop any sort of intuition about the subject matter. Examples in lecture present a ton of data on flight paths and the like, but are provided with little explanation of their significance.  When a student asks a question that cannot be answered directly from the slides, you can actually see the depth of the professor's knowledge, but lectures are otherwise not worthwhile.  The slides are convenient for looking up equations for the homework which is about the most mentally taxing thing you are asked to do.\nThe assignments are of little benefit to the students.  They do very little to teach flight dynamics and consume a ridiculous amount of time as do all reports.  Students were generally not well prepared to do the assignment, as most assignments produced a series of emails containing clarifications and hints.  Comments on written work were generally requests for \"more.\"  It was never stated why the given explanation was insufficient or what important piece of the explanation had been left out.  Quantity not quality seemed to be goal.\nProfessor Stengel's book is actually more interesting than his lectures.\nI never attended precept, but I hear that they were not very helpful.  Most questions were answered by the professor via email anyway, so it seemed that the preceptors had little role to play.\nChange just about anything and it would probably be an improvement.

But be warned, Professor Stengel is not the most gifted lecturer. He is monotone and reads equations to you, but you will be forced to go to lecture because of his participation grade, and you can't even use electronics because he will get mad at you. BUT talk to him outside of class, he's a really cool and interesting guy who will always want to give you advice on the psets, career, life, whatever.

The textbook is never used, so it really is not worth buying unless you want a different take on everything Bogan is lecturing about. The class mainly relies on a pequod packet which contains the readings and problem sets. Bogan does a great job of incorporating historical examples along with modern political arguments over issues such as the national debt. Sure I learned about macroeconomic theory, but I'm much more excited about all of the economic political relevance that I now have a better grasp on. The course is worth taking for this value alone. Bogan does a very good job of remaining pretty neutral in her criticism of both democrats and republicans (although she feels the dems are closer in actually understanding how a cyclical economy works).

The aim of the course is two-fold: (1) to understand the game-theoretic issues behind systems involving computation such as online networks, and (2) to learn how algorithms and algorithmic thinking can help with designing better decision and allocation mechanisms in the offline world.", "termid": "1132", "classes": [{"classnum": "23028", "enroll": "93", "limit": "150", "starttime": "3:00 pm", "section": "L01", "endtime": "4:20 pm", "roomnum": "101", "days": "MW", "bldg": "Friend Center"}, {"classnum": "23164", "enroll": "40", "limit": "52", "starttime": "7:30 pm", "section": "P01", "endtime": "8:20 pm", "roomnum": "112", "days": "W", "bldg": "Friend Center"}, {"classnum": "23225", "enroll": "0", "limit": "1", "starttime": "7:30 pm", "section": "P01A", "endtime": "8:20 pm", "roomnum": "109", "days": "W", "bldg": "Friend Center"}, {"classnum": "23204", "enroll": "16", "limit": "25", "starttime": "1:30 pm", "section": "P02", "endtime": "2:20 pm", "roomnum": "008", "days": "F", "bldg": "Friend Center"}, {"classnum": "23205", "enroll": "13", "limit": "25", "starttime": "2:30 pm", "section": "P03", "endtime": "3:20 pm", "roomnum": "008", "days": "F", "bldg": "Friend Center"}, {"classnum": "23302", "enroll": "23", "limit": "32", "starttime": "7:30 pm", "section": "P04", "endtime": "8:20 pm", "roomnum": "105", "days": "M", "bldg": "Bobst Hall"}, {"classnum": "24196", "enroll": "1", "limit": "1", "starttime": "7:30 pm", "section": "P04A", "endtime": "8:20 pm", "roomnum": "112", "days": "M", "bldg": "Friend Center"}]},

I think that now, with the knowledge I got from this semester, would be a good point for me to take this class. Having background information would help me to learn a lot more and gain more from the class.

I had a lot of experience with mathematical proofs beforehand, but found the sheer amount of homework to be overwhelming rather than the specific topics covered.  If you are comfortable with proofs it might be better to take the more advanced track, as it did not seem to be significantly more work but covered somewhat more interesting topics, in my personal opinion.

Macedo is really animated and excited, and also provides a good overview of the readings, which is especially helpful when they're really dense and complicated.

I'm taking only 3 courses with one of them being  a PDF, and I'm still just barely getting by. I'm probably not gonna look back on Design with fond memories. You'll be spending most of your time in the EQuad from now, so get comfortable. People also found the Design lab to be chilly all the time, so invest in a nice sweater and a nice pair of sweats as well. On a more positive note, the optimization portion of the class is fascinating, and it is quite satisfying when you get your Aspen and GAMS programs to do what you want. Prof. Floudas is a great lecturer and a very personable guy, and the TAs were fantastic and extremely patient. It's just unfortunate that the aspect of the course with which we spent the most time, Aspen, was undeniably the most painful. Make sure to work with people with whom you get along and can work productively. You're in for quite the experience ;)", "Sorry CBEs, you have to take this course even if you never in your life plan to do anything related to this. This course is outdated and should be either tailored to the types of CBEs at Princeton now or removed entirely.", "Sorry, kids. Just get through it and graduate.", "Take it if you have to.", "Try not to spend your whole life working on this class.", "Unfortunately with these sorts of things I guess you don't have a choice.", "Well, I hope you're happy. You were warned time and time again to change majors, yet you've persisted in your boundless ignorance. Sure, your earlier forays into the blight that is Chemical Engineering can be chalked up to freshman naivety. \"Yes, Intro is dull, and Separations is useless, but beginners courses are always terrible. I bet the higher-level classes are intellectually stimulating and legitimately useful.\" But you're no longer a child, and you've run out of excuses. Yet here you stand. But fear not, dear Sisyphus?Christodoulos A. Floudas, Lord of Sorrows, is here to punish you for hubris. And rest assured, Floudas' torments are far crueler than merely consigning you to an eternity of pushing a boulder up a hill. \"So,\" you ask, \"you're saying that Design is an exercise in futility?\" No. Attempting to broker a peace between Israel and Palestine would be an \"exercise in futility.\" Design is no mere exercise; it is futility and wickedness given physical form. When Pandora, a fool much like yourself, opened her malignant box, the pestilence released into the world was termed \"Aspen Plus.\" Don't believe me? Of course you don't?anyone capable of rational thought has long since abandoned this major. So allow me to provide a brief preview of your senior fall semester: you know how thesis advisers require a minimum of 20 hours in lab a week? You will fall far short of that goal as you spend those 20+ hours debugging your Design simulations and conducting process synthesis literature reviews. You have to write 40 pages for your senior thesis? That's cute. The average midterm Design PROPOSAL is 50+ pages. Your final paper will easily double that. As the semester progresses, your incessant Design whining will cause all your non-CBE friends to abandon you. And you deserve it, because you have no one to blame but yourself for your misfortune. In the last two weeks before Dean's Date, you will literally spend every waking hour in the Design lab. And when I say literally,", "Well, you're a senior CBE so it's too late to make any decisions about \"considering taking this course\". Take good notes during lecture because you will need to memorize everything for the final, which is long, difficult, and impossible to finish. Project-wise, also be prepared for something long, difficult, and (nearly) impossible to finish - best advice would be to start early and work on it regularly (which is really hard fall semester senior year, especially if you plan on working on your thesis). Ask the TAs for help (and be grateful because they will help you a lot), even just to be clear about what your project objectives are, the general roadmap, and steps you should be taking for your project. Sleep will seem that much more beautiful after this class - relish it. Also, relish all the bonding experiences you'll have with your fellow CBE'ers. You'll make it to the end.", "You have no choice.", "You know who you are and you have to do it. Good luck.", "You will hear this from others as well, just like we have all heard this from students in many of our classes in the past.  I have never listened myself, but I implore you: Do. NOT. Procrastinate. On. This. Project.  I didn?t realize until it was far too late that the lectures were not just conceptual supplements to the idea of process design ? they actually tell you how to do the analysis portion of the project, and the lectures are reeeeally good.  My group spent so long putting together the simulation that we had to cram in some version of the detailed analysis we had learned in class in the last few days.  The result of this was that we really know what we were doing on the analysis like we could have.  Also, we hadn?t learned the lectures the first time because we weren?t applying the material to the project, so that was two lost opportunities.  If you start researching ideas the MOMENT you get the project assignment (and, like, actually hardcore researching), the semester will go much better.  Semester beginnings are much more chill than middles and especially ends; you are just coming out of summer, the workload hasn?t piled up yet, and you?re still awake.  Use this time to research process ideas, and start simulating as soon as you learn aspen.  You?ll soon discover that not all papers have enough information to simulate, and you?ll start to see what will and what won?t be an option for use in the project.  You?ll gain a familiarity with aspen BEFORE the assignment is due, and you?ll freak out less when reactors don?t work for whatever reason (WATCH YOUR UNITS!!!! ASPEN IS PICKY!!!).  And then when Professor Floudas starts talking about how to size reactors and economics analysis in lecture (his lectures are really good!), it won?t just be this nebulous concept that you?ll write down but then forget until the final, it will be a tool you can immediately put to use because you already know what you?ll probably use for your process simulation, and you?ll learn", "be prepared for what you are getting into", "don't take other hard classes, because this course is ridiculous and unfortunately a departmental.", "get ready for long hours, boring lectures, and confusing instruction", "try to work on the project at a consistent pace and try not to get too frustrated with other group members, as that is usually counterproductive."], "area": "STL", "ratings": [["Lectures", "Laboratories", "Readings", "Papers, Reports, Problem Sets, Examinations", "Overall Quality of the Course", "Feedback for other students"], [3.21, 4.09, 2.5, 2.12, 2.26, 2.56]], "prereqs": "CBE 341 and CBE 441..", "descrip": "Introduction to chemical process flow-sheeting; process simulation design, sizing and cost estimation of total processes; process economics; introduction to optimization, linear programming, integer programming, and nonlinear programming; heat integration methods, minimum utility cost, minimum number of units, network optimization.", "termid": "1132", "classes": [{"classnum": "21003", "enroll": "44", "limit": "45", "starttime": "11:00 am", "section": "L01", "endtime": "11:50 am", "roomnum": "A224", "days": "MWF", "bldg": "Engineering Quad A-Wing"}, {"classnum": "21002", "enroll": "44", "limit": "45", "starttime": "7:30 pm", "section": "B01", "endtime": "8:50 pm", "roomnum": "A124", "days": "W", "bldg": "Engineering Quad A-Wing"}]},
