Don't procrastinate on labs and the problem sets aren't particularly hard so the work is manageable if you manage your time wisely.", "This is an extremely challenging course. I have little background in chemistry, and took this course under the recommendation of my academic advisor, who said that it was similar to 201-202 with a few more concepts. From what I can tell, there is a world of difference between the two courses. You should only take this if you're willing to put in the work, and either have a talent for chemistry or a strong background. Go to office hours if you don't understand something because it is VERY easy to fall behind.", "This is an interesting and engaging chem course, with good (famous!) lecturers and fun demos. The materials science stuff is cool to know for engineers. Just don't skip lecture, and use class and the readings to fill in any holes in your understanding. My understanding is that the exams are harder than 201, but if you're not really interested in chemistry in particular, you'll want as engaging a class as possible, and this is it. That was my situation, and while I'm doing about average, that's with no extraordinary effort (the homework is often pretty easy).", "Try to keep up on the readings and ask questions in precept.

It might have been okay for people pursuing neuroscience, but I found it very difficult to follow, and it assumed more background in physics/biology/chemistry than I expected. Not very engaging, so I wouldn't recommend taking this just for the distribution requirement.", "I honestly chose this class because I needed to take it for a certificate program and it sounded the best. It ended up being my favourite class of the semester. The lectures and material are super interesting. All of the exams are multiple choice.", "I recommend taking the class. The material is extremely interesting. The lectures reflect the readings, allowing the material to be solidified for the students.", "I think NEU 201 needs some changes; to my understanding, it had an overhaul this year, and no doubt once they receive feedback, it will continue to revise. When that happens, I'm sure it will be a great class for all students-- but at this point, I cannot in good conscience recommend the class to other students.", "I think that it is extremely important to keep up with the textbook readings, as the material is discussed in lecture and ultimately tested on the exams. Also, go to lecture and precept! The instructors emphasized that the material on the exams would consist mostly of the overlap among the book, lectures, and precepts.", "I thought that it was very interesting, but challenging to someone without a very strong science background.", "I would advise future students to take this course if they are considering neuro as a possible concentration or certificate.", "I would not take this course unless you know it's going to be significantly different from this year's incarnation. Different in literally any way, because it cannot get worse than it was this year.", "I would recommend taking this class only if you have a serious interest in Neuroscience and really want to learn about it, otherwise it will be a chore.", "I would strongly advise reading the textbook chapters each week and making notes on them. This makes following lecture and revision for the exams much easier.", "I would tell the student to read the chapter the lecture covers after the lecture", "I wouldn't recommend taking this course - Professor Witten clearly knows her subject very well, but it wasn't conveyed in a way that made it easy to understand. I relied a lot on the textbook, since the lectures were pretty much straight from there.", "If I was a friend with this other student, I would tell them in no uncertain terms to NOT take this course. Maybe I'd recommend the class if the other student was my arch enemy...but probably not even then, that would be too mean.", "If Ilana Witten is teaching this course, I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU DO NOT TAKE IT. This was the worst course of my Princeton career; she took away all the possible fun of Neuroscience. I took this course purely out of interest and ended up resenting it because it was so technical and barely spent any time on the applications of the technicalities; i.e. why are they important. I normally do not write course reviews, but I felt the need to do so for this class. Please try to take with Graziano; I heard he is so much better and I regret not taking it with him. SO much.", "If Ilana's teaching this and you have to take it, I'm very sorry for you.", "If at all possible, take this course with Professor Graziano. Professor Witten was really enthusiastic but she wasn't the clearest lecturer. Especially when the subject got highly technical, it was hard to follow along with what she was saying.", "If it wasn't for the required precepts and graded class attendance, I wouldn't have ever gone to class just because EVERYTHING you need to get an A in this class is in the textbook, which is nice (but it also makes lectures so repetitive and useless).

Beware of the boring, dense content though.", "If prof witten is teaching do not take.", "If you can get away from the course, get away from it.", "If you have to take it for the certificate/major, then you have to take it. It will definitely improve after this year, given that it is a new course. If you have a general interest in neuroscience, there are better introductory courses.", "If you like focusing on biology, you might like this course. Otherwise, probably just take psych. The lectures and material were not very engaging, but maybe it is just because the course was restructured this year.", "If you want a good grade, go to lectures and take good notes and memorize them. Do that, or you can just memorize the book, but the book is really dense and can be hard to understand.", "Interesting topic, but lectures were somewhat disorganized and sometimes confusing. Neuroscience is a hot topic, and it is good to learn what the hype is about.", "It's a budding department, so don't expect a perfectly polished course, but you'll come away from the semester with knowledge of basic neuroscience. I'd suggest reading the textbook first (if you have time) and then using lecture as review, because the lecture alone won't help you learn the material in the depth that you need.", "It's a good and interesting class. Material can be very technical at times.", "Keep on top of the material - it piles up. If you're not PDFing, you better do all the reading and study it as you go along.", "Large quantity of highly interesting material. The more scrupulous student may pride him or herself in knowing all of it only to be disappointed on the only-cosmetic coverage of most topics on the exams.

Overall, it's a good introductory neuro course that will convince most of you, I imagine, not to take 202.", "Lectures are a bit rough, but if you're interested in the material it is worth it. Precepts really help in understanding the material too. No assignments make it fairly easy throughout the semester, until exams approach. Warning: there is a lot of memorization involved.", "Lectures required us to use iclickers. While the lecture was practically entirely from the book.

Wouldn't recommend it.", "Make sure to study the textbook for the exams!", "Make sure you are really really interested in neuro or psych. If not it's not as worth it", "Make sure you are staying on top of the material. Don't wait until the exams.", "Make time to read the readings BEFORE and AFTER lecture to solidify your understanding. It is a lot of material for 12 weeks and can get really overwhelming, especially since the class can easily be pushed aside for its lack of active work throughout the semester. Make sure you donate just as much time to this class a week as you would to your other classes and you should be fine.", "My experience with NEU 201 was terrible. I'm getting a good grade, but consider this class to me worst choice this semester. I believe introductory neuroscience can be fascinating if taught by an engaging professor, but in this case, both the lecturer and the textbook were dense. So, bottom line, avoid if possible if Prof. Witten is teaching.", "NEU 201 is a fairly interesting course, albeit dense at times. Workload is very manageable with readings being the only out of class work. If you are a good multiple choice test taker, this course will be even more manageable for you. Witten is an okay lecturer, slightly rushed at times.", "NEU201 has new instructor, new syllabus, new exam; the exams particularly focus more on the small details of neurobiological processes instead of the broader picture/concept of such processes.  So the course isn't going to be as easy as many have initially thought by former NEU258 students saying the exam and course is very easy. \nWill hugely benefit from this course if you do the readings regularly and not lag behind; precept participation grades will deter you from doing so anyways.", "Not the most engaging course, but the material can be interesting.", "Only take this class if you are pre-med or neuro major. I took this class because I had a general interest in the subject. I was told that Graziano was an awesome lecturer and was really excited to learn the material from such an engaging lecturer. Witten is a nice lady, but not a good lecturer at all, and presents the material in a very dry way.", "Only take this course if you are prepared to really study the textbook. Youtube videos and lectures help to some extent, but the textbook is really of the utmost importance. If you are interested and willing to put in the time, it is definitely worth it and you will learn a lot!", "Please think hard before you take this course. Higher level neuro classes are better taught, more interesting, and not unreasonably difficult.", "Poorly structured course. The lecturer was is inexperienced and nervous and cannot teach. The lecturer and preceptors kept changing their minds about how to assess us, making life difficult. Exams were multiple-choice, which made it easy but hard at the same time. Single mistakes could cost you a lot on the curve. The class was just the biggest joke. You need to know small details even though they say you only need general concepts. Do not take this class unless you have to. I wanted to get a neuro certificate but I gave it up after taking this class because this is literally the most uninteresting, most poorly structured and taught class I have ever taken at Princeton. I could not sit through another semester of this.", "Pretty dry; huge gap between work required for B and work required for A.", "Professor was pretty bad. Textbook is decent, multiple choice exams make it easier.", "Read the textbook!", "Run away. Run as far as possible from this course. It will melt your brain. Do not take this course. I know Neuroscience is new and flashy, but do not take this course. If you are thinking of joining Neuroscience, I extend my condolences to whatever sense of wonder you have that will be destroyed by the sheer awfulness of this course.", "Solid but unspectacular.

There are definitely interesting parts, but a lot is quite dry.", "Take it if you're interested in neuroscience.", "Take it only if you need a STN", "Take it!  The class is very interesting.   Do the readings and take good notes, or the exams will be tough.", "Take it! I believe everybody should have a basic understanding of how our brains work.", "Take it, but be ready to listen and take notes in lecture to grasp the main ideas (textbook is overly technical at times).", "Take it, it's not the worst thing that's ever happened. First half of the course is almost too easy, then it get's ridiculously complex. Ilana is a good lecturer, but also, make sure your preceptor is good. Lots of memorization and terms, but fairly interesting.", "Take really good notes each lecture! Just compile them into a study guide and go over them. Read the descriptions in the book of the diagrams/visuals in lecture for the tests. Really not that hard, and if you pay attention in class, it'll be a breeze.", "Take the class if you are going to do a major/certificate related to Neuroscience.", "Take this class if you are really interested in Neuro, or are think you might be. Don't take it just to fulfill a distribution requirement because you will be bored.", "Take this class if you're strongly interested in neuroscience, just so you can learn the basis and go on to take more interesting courses in the field. Witten's lectures are dry and somewhat anxiety-inducing, as she complicates everything to an unnecessary degree.", "Take this course for departmental requirements and make sure you are passionate about the subject. There is a low amount of given work throughout the semester but it is important to maintain weekly readings and constant reinforcement of material.", "Take this course if you are interested in neuroscience and are considering the concentration. Although this course is easy, it is also not taught well, so those who are not NEU majors may find a more rewarding experience in other courses.", "Take this course. Unless you hate science, it has something for everyone.", "Terrible course. Lecturer read out of the textbook, tests were hard, and it felt like the class was being taught for the first time", "The course grade is almost entirely based on exams. The exams are poorly written, confusing, and try to trick you out of points at every opportunity. They focus on very minute details and very few details instead of trying to judge general knowledge or being of appropriate length to test a decent subset of the material. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to.", "The fact that the midterms and final were multiple choice tests was pretty indicative of the level of effort that seemed to have gone into planning this course. Badly taught, but the subject matter was interesting and it wasn't especially hard to do well.", "The lectures aren't really the most interesting things in the world. That said, I do feel like I learned about how the brain functions, which was my main goal in the course.", "The material was interesting but the lectures were very hard to follow.", "The textbook is very important to the class", "There are better STNs if you're in it for the distribution requirement. The course was relatively easy, yes, but the lectures and readings were mind-numbing (and often WAY too advanced and in depth for an intro course). Steer clear!", "This class presents the material relatively clearly and involves a lot of interesting concepts. However, I felt as though we learned a lot of facts and just memorized a lot of things, and that the course didn't involve understanding nuances, deeper analysis of problems, or thinking beyond surface-level concepts. I'm not sure if this is because it's an introductory neuroscience class, but be prepared to have to memorize a lot.", "This course covers a lot of content, so make sure to keep up with the readings. Witten is a good lecturer. The exams were sort of unorganized and the questions were kind of poorly written, but the curves usually reflected that. A great course for people being introduced the field, as you're bound to come upon a topic that will fascinate you and that you can learn more about in later years.", "This course is almost entirely dependent on your ability to memorize material which can be exceedingly challenging. Certainly not an easy STN.", "This course requires a lot of memorization. The exams are all multiple choice.", "This course was challenging but in a fair manner. The lectures and precepts were engaging. The textbook was very detailed, but keeping up with the reading was the best way to study for this class.", "This course was taught by Professor Witten (not the usual NEU 201 teacheR). She was not aLwayS so clear in lecture and her slides frequently had graphs without any text- forcing us to kind of guess what the experiment was and what we should get from it. She got more confident throughout the course of the semester but it wasn't always the most invigorating lectures. Anne Mennon is a good preceptor if she's still doing it. The problem with this course is really the exams. They were all multiple choice and tested minutia from the textbook which is just such a frustrating test style for people who don't memorize things perfectly. Overall fine course, but there is room for improvement and I'm sure Witten will make that improvement as she continues to tech this course.", "This course, though introductory, is heavily based on intense scientific knowledge. One should not enroll in this course unless they are either passionate about science or willing to work very hard to understand the concepts. This is not a good course to use to fulfill a science requirement.", "This is NOT an easy PDF, be prepared to do lots of work around exam time. Keep up with the readings, lectures are not detailed enough to prepare for the exams.", "This is a fine STN filler if you can take good notes and memorize details (at least temporarily). It's interesting enough to not feel like a waste of time, but not so hard that you'll feel like you're dying--- IF you pay attention in lecture. The textbook is confusing, and there is actually no use in buying it if you take thorough lecture notes.", "Took this course PDF. Minimal work when pdf'ing. Only need to attend lectures and study for exams. A lot of material is covered in lecture. It can be hard to memorize everything but as a PDF you should be golden , I believe in you.", "Typical science class much like the AP classes you take in high school.

Readings for certain topics like effective altruism were wonderfully light but still of great substance, whereas other subjects (I believe those relating to animals in particular) seemed almost burdensome. Essays were spaced out and doable; set up an appointment with your preceptor before due dates so you can discuss ideas, find possible loopholes in your arguments, etc. Precepts meet only once a week and often are almost too short for all the great ideas shared in them. (Strangely, however, I kinda burned out around halfway through the semester [probably just after effective altruism] and never quite got back to the same level of commitment afterwards. Not entirely sure why.) On a brighter note, don't stress too much about the final. If you have gone to lectures and understood the main points of the readings, you will be more than sufficiently prepared.

It's changed the way I think about things.  It's definitely frustrating that you don't get to really delve deeply into the issues, but I was glad that we were introduced to so many different topics.", "I would highly recommend this course and would advise students to read all of the required and additional reading assignments.", "I would highly recommend this course to other students because Peter Singer has very interesting, engaging views on certain topics that are commonly debated in philosophy today. His class is well organized and papers were interesting in that we could almost choose whichever topic we wanted to write on.", "I would only recommend this course if you are interested in the material.

Well reasoned evil, but still evil. If that appeals to you, then take this class. If you want to be challenged by ideas but know that you wont be motivated if youre not taking a class, take this class. If youre looking for a relatively easy class, take this class. But also, come in with a strong head, and realize that, in addition to being a nutcase Singer is also not a good lecturer. Precepts though will likely be lively and interesting", "IT IS A MUST TAKE BEFORE YOU GRADUATE!

I really think this is one of those courses that all students should take just because of the way it makes you question your moral assumptions and intuitions. Even if you don't agree with all of Singer's points, it's worth thinking about. My only thing is that for me personally, I found the papers hard to do well on so if you're looking for an easy A this wouldn't be it - it'd definitely be a very good pdf though! (Kind of wish I had done that when I had the chance)", "Only take this class if you absolutely have to for a requirement or if it's the only ethics class you can fit in your schedule. Ethics and Public Policy with Macedo was much more interesting and the appeal of Singer alone just isn't going to carry you through the entirety of this course. The lectures are extremely boring and Singer doesn't really ever present all sides of the argument in a convincing manner. Not worth the PDF either because it's three papers and a final.", "Pay more attention to lectures than readings, since apparently that helps you prepare better for the final.", "Peter Singer is amazing and the content is varied enough that it stays interesting throughout the semester. Take it as a PDF.", "Peter Singer is great, but the final is a bit stressful.", "Peter Singer is very worth listening to, even if the readings aren't especially exciting. I would recommend a bit of formal philosophical background (another class, etc) in order to best have a handle on the material.", "Peter Singer presents a course that should be good life education for most. It is academically of medium difficulty, and should be worth it.", "Prepare to spend a LOT of time reading for this class every week. Would recommend not doing all of the reading.", "Prof Singer is great.  Take it.", "Professor Singer is on the frontier of modern ethical thought. His course will put you in touch with some thought provoking issues. It is not as well designed as it could be, however.", "Professor Singer is perhaps one of the most influential philosophers of today, and being able to take a class with him is a unique Princeton experience. It may not be the most rigorous philosophy course, but presents some of the most relevant and interesting ethical debates of today.", "Read as much as possible!", "Reccomend if interested in the topic.", "Send drafts/outlines to your preceptor for feedback on essays. Also, relying on your laptop for lectures may not be the best approach because it doesn't force you to add any new comments then what is on the powerpoints. Having a notebook might be more helpful.", "Singer is a little overrated, honestly. His books are as great as they say, but having already read some of his writings I didn't get much additional enjoyment/learning from taking the class. Still, it was a pretty fun way to do the EM distribution requirement. Not sure I could have found a better class for EM.", "Start ahead on essays. You can get away without doing the readings for a majority of the course (not sure about the final yet), but it's best to at least skim it. Keep up with material so that you can understand and explore it more in precept and class.", "TAKE IT.", "Take it if you'd like.", "Take it!

Singer is a great lecturer.", "Take the course, you will learn a lot and your views will be challenged! Try to make sure you are placed with a preceptor that will facilitate discussion and allow the topics to be as interesting as they truly are.", "Take this class for Singer. Don't take it for an in-depth philosophy course.", "Take this class if you're looking for a decent philosophy/ethics survey course. If your current moral values do not align with that of the professor you're in for a treat; you'll probably learn quite a bit. If they does, this class might be a bit of a snooze. You should probably take the papers pretty seriously but it is not warranted that you do all of the readings. It's a pretty chill class and it would probably be great to PDF or audit. Basically, unless you have a keen interest in a pretty large survey of philosophical/ethical issues, there are probably more invigorating CHV/PHI course elsewhere.", "Take this class to meet the distribution requirement or if you are interested.", "Take this course if you enjoy philosophy, and writing philosophy papers.  While the material/reading may be light, your grading depends on your experience in organizing these kinds of papers and your preceptor, regardless of understanding of the material at times, which was frustrating.  I did not enjoy this course.", "Take this course! It's one of the only classes I've taken at Princeton where nearly every student attends every lecture, which is saying something. This class has modified, strengthened, and sometimes even reversed my opinion on some ethical issues. The material is very relevant, no matter what path you will pursue later on.", "Take this course. No problem if it's your first philosophy course.", "Take this!! It's incredibly interesting and makes you think so much. You'll get out of it what you put into it - it's not a lot of work so you can skate by if you want to, but putting in effort makes it so much better. Peter Singer isn't afraid to have people disagree with him and assigns great readings.", "Take your precepts with Amy Hondo if you can.", "Take!!", "The course is interesting but is a lot of work", "The reading is manageable and really interesting! The lectures less so.", "There are a lot of readings, but it is an interesting course.", "This class gives you an overview of the philosophy behind a lot of issues, but by no means makes you an expert.", "This is a class everyone should take. It applies to anyone living in our modern world, regardless of your intended occupation. The readings are interesting so barely seem like work. Some preceptors have very high expectations for papers though so be ready.", "This is a class you must take before graduating!", "This is a good class that will be interesting. You talk about real topics and the ethical arguments behind them. This class is a good amount of work so don't take it if you don't have the time or can't PDF. It's a good EM.", "This is a great class both academically and in terms of forcing you to think harder about the ethics of things you might do every day. The grading is fair and the readings are accessible and not overwhelming. Prof. Singer is a fantastic lecturer and an even better preceptor.", "This really is a good class. It forces you to think about a lot of important ethical issues that are very relevant for today, but you can ignore if you don't directly encounter them (for instance, should you ever let a baby die? The answer might not be as obvious as you think).", "Unfortunately, Singer probably won't be teaching this course again, and I'm not sure how it will be without him. As long as they don't change topics too much, I would probably still take the class. I found the materials really interesting and thought provoking, and the assignments were generally fair and not too much work.", "Very interesting, great class to PDF, because the course is incredibly interesting and really makes you think. An A is feasible, but a fair amount of work is required. Try and get Mr. Harris as a preceptor if you can, he's awesome.", "You should take this class if you want to be exposed to a variety of ethical issues.

It's more difficult than some, but Professor Bakos' lectures are really great (go to them!).", "This is a great class.  I took it for the STN, but it's been one of my favorite classes so far.  Lectures are really fantastic, and Professor Bakos is very kind and goes out of his way to learn names and help people out.  A lot of people PDF this, so the curve is very generous and it's not that difficult to do well on tests if you show up to lectures (which, again, are very good anyways) and study a little.  Take advantage of office hours for help with homework.", "This is a great course.  You definitely get back what you put in, especially on the very challenging homework assignments.  I also enjoyed venturing out to the golf course and roof of Peyton Hall to observe and take pictures of stars and galaxies.", "This was a fantastic class. The lectures are great - there wasn't a single class where Prof. Bakos didn't make everyone laugh and think about the world a different way. Don't procrastinate on the homework, and reach out sooner rather than later if you need help.", "Tough STN, Psets are hard.", "While this course is dubbed \"Stars for Stoners,\" it is everything but the lax class everyone expected.

And finally, always go to precept.", "A great course, though definitely be prepared for a lot of work. Overall, so glad I took this course.", "A great, interesting class to take no matter what you are studying.  Everyone should have some idea of how computers work, and this course does a good job of shedding some light on that question.", "A significant time commitment is required to do well in the course, but still very enjoyable and a good experience.", "A worthwhile course to take, can be challenging at times, especially if you have not coded before or if coding is difficult for you. The assignments build up nicely, and there are lots of opportunities to receive help in this course. If you have not coded before, I recommend enrolling in a longer precept. Overall, I would recommend this course to any Princeton student who wishes to learn more about programming in Java.", "Awesome class! It is really well designed and even if you have limited experience, everybody is willing to help you get through the assignments", "Be prepared to carve out a decent chunk of time every week to do assignments.

Its not a simple intro course.", "Be sure you watch the lectures when they are assigned so that you can contribute to precept--too many of my peers were rushing to catch up on the lectures right before exams, since they aren't really necessary to complete the weekly assignments.", "Best course I've taken so far at Princeton. Everyone should take it.", "COS 126 is a great class for those interested in learning how to program (even non COS majors). There are many resources available to help students that are both helpful and easily accessible. The course overall places a heavier emphasis on historical/theoretical computer science than I would have expected. Absolutely would recommend.", "COS 126 is a lot of work, so be ready to put in time, especially for your weekly assignments. It's definitely challenging, but the amount of computer science and code I learned in a semester made it all worth it.", "COS 126 is very difficult if you haven't coded, but very interesting nonetheless. Definitely take it and be amazed with what you can do by the end of the course! Be prepared to dedicate all of your time to coding, though.", "COS126 is a solid course overall; after a semester, the course has given me a solid grasp of Java's ins and outs, and a good general understanding of the basics of computer science. However, a lot of the material seems rushed, and the assignments always seem to be at the very frontier of your ability, so make sure to keep on top of watching lectures and going to office hours.", "Definitely a great course to take for general computer science knowledge in the 21st century. Not an easy course, but definitely worth it in my mind. Start the assignments early, they often take longer than you expect they might. There is SO much help available for the assignments between Lab TAs and office hours. If you start early, you can better  take advantage of these resources.", "Definitely take it. Even if you don't think you'll enjoy cs, it's something everyone should at least be familiar about.", "Definitely take it. I think the extra 30 mins in a novice precept are definitely worth it and Alan Kaplan is a great preceptor.", "Definitely take the course (and take the novice precept)! Although some preceptors are better than others, you can switch around and find one that works for you.

It was very interesting and almost made me want to switch my major to COS.", "Definitely take this course -- programming is a life skill. The course can get tricky and overwhelming at times: don't be afraid to ask for help. If you're stuck on an assignment, put it away and come back to it tomorrow -- don't agonize over what's probably a very simple bug (and don't procrastinate either, by that logic).

It's an extremely engaging introduction to general computer science.", "Definitely take this course. You will learn the most from precepts and the textbook and not so much from online lectures (this was the first semester that Professor Sedgewick decided to make the transition from in-class to online lecturing). The online lectures serve as a useful resource for preparation and studying; however, I found them to be ineffective in comparison to some of the in-class lectures Sedgewick and fellow lecturers conducted. For someone who had never programmed before, it was very difficult to learn both programming and theory at such a fast pace. I often found that I didn't have the time to absorb fundamental aspects of object-oriented programming quickly enough to do the assignments without some trouble.", "Despite being a difficult class, this was a very enjoyable and well taught class that I would recommend to everyone.", "Do not take unless you are already great at coding.", "Do precept problems before precept.

I have found grad students and instructors to be much more useful than Lab TAs.", "Great class, but moves very fast. Great choice for a pdf.", "Great class, extremely well taught. Assignments are fun. Strongly recommended.", "Great course, but video lectures aren't so great and are pretty annoying.", "Great intro to CS", "Great introductory course! Anyone even remotely considering computer science as an interest of his/hers should definitely take this course. It covers quite a lot!", "HORRIBLE idea to have online only lectures. It's not interactive, it's not engaging, and it's not why I came to Princeton. Sure, videos may be more convenient - but videos can be done alongside actual lectures, too.", "I came in as a freshman with no programming experience and even though I'm NOT a natural and I'm actually pretty bad at this, I absolutely loved the course. Well organized, very useful, can be a lot of fun. I had a lot of time to spend on the assignments, so I may have had a different response if I took it with a heavier course load.", "I highly recommend that you take this course.

The assignments are fun and give you an awesome sense of accomplishment at the end.", "I highly recommend this class if you are interested in learning about programming. I had never programmed before, and I feel like I learned a lot. As long as you stay on top of the material and are willing to go to office hours when you need help, the class is very manageable.", "I really enjoyed this course and took it instead of higher level math for MOL major. Its definitely challenging and time-consuming, but the process of programming is very rewarding. The TAs are really the best. Office hours are always available. It is always possible to get >90% if not 100% on all the assignments. Get Donna or Dan as preceptor. They are really helpful, especially Donna", "I recommend students to take the course, because it teaches valuable and necessary skills. However, students must be willing to put in the necessary time and effort to succeed.", "I started this course with zero coding experience, and I enjoyed it a lot. I would definitely urge you to have a go. It's worth it!", "I think it is such an interesting and useful skill to have", "I think that for an introductory computer science course, this course is very good. However, for someone new to programming you should expect to invest quite a bit of time and effort. For someone who already has programming experience, the last 2-3 weeks of the course involving computer science theory, Boolean algebra, CPU/circuit design are probably the most challenging, so definitely don?t skip those lectures.", "I would advise students to try to watch all the lectures and read the book to understand the material and to go to precept for review. I would also advise them to try to avoid falling behind.", "I would be sure to go to precept, and to keep up with all of the course readings and lectures.", "I would definitely recommend this course to any one remotely interested in the subject.", "I would give all students taking this course to keep up with the work and do the work as soon as possible, because it helps staying on top of all the material. Falling behind in this class seems to be something really easy to do. I also recommend taking Alan Kaplan's precept, because he is very engaging and makes the material seem less intimidating.", "I would recommend that everybody take this course. It is super interesting even if you arent planning on majoring in COS. My advice would be to start early on assignments and reach out for help when you need it.", "I would recommend this class if they are willing to dedicate a significant amount of time to it, and if the rest of their schedule isn't too tough.", "I would tell future students to stay on top of watching the lectures and doing the readings and master the content as it comes because this will greatly help when it comes times for assignments and exams.", "If programming makes sense to you and you work hard, this course is no problem.", "If you are a beginning coder like me, you can get through the course but it is quite frustrating at times watching other coders who are experienced complaining about an exam being too easy.", "If you are a humanities major and/or an absolute beginner taking COS because you're interested (and perhaps for the QR), just PDF it?even if you think the first couple exams go well. You'll save yourself so much stress and worrying.", "If you are completely new to \"programming\" or \"coding\", the impolite way this course rushes into things may not feel nice. For the most part, programming assignments can be solved by following the step by step instructions. Just read the instructions. This course isn't godly but it's alright. Sometime the video lectures go over 50 minutes, which annoys me.", "If you are even vaguely interested in COS, take this course. It is an amazing introduction.  However, don't be fooled by the first two weeks, you WILL get behind if you don't keep up. Nevertheless, you'll learn a ton and if you even vaguely care about computing or even just about how computers work, take the course.", "If you don't have coding experience, you really want to be in a novice precept, and the course is very difficult for those not inclined towards math or computer science, but the course on the whole is surprisingly fun and definitely worth taking.", "If you have a genuine interest or curiosity in the material, take this class. It is incredibly well taught, and you learn more than in most other classes at Princeton.", "If you have coded in Java before and are decently mathematics-oriented, Cos126 might not be the best choice.  I was in this boat; I learned very little from first half of the course (since I had already programmed), and while everything in the theoretical second half was new to me, I feel I could simply pick it up as I go along in Cos226.  Talk to your advisor, talk to past students.  Make sure 126 is right for you.\nOtherwise, go for it.  It's a great intro to computer science.  There are tons of resources out there for you.  Use exactly what you need.", "If you have never programmed before, then this class is difficult. If you have, I would recommend doing a good amount of studying for the written exams, because they aren't easy, even for experienced programmers. There are now deductions for multiple choice questions.\nTo learn programming, you really have to practice, so do some hacking in your free time. Frequently writing code will allow you to remember the concepts and understand firsthand why certain things are important.\nDo the extra credit if you can.", "If you have no prior cos experience, you'll probably have a harder time in the class than the kids who've already coded for years.", "If you know how to code already this will be a breeze, take it for the easy A.", "If you take this course, be prepared to work very hard and dedicate a lot of time to this subject.", "If you want to do well, try to come in with some basic knowledge of computer science. Always take advantage of office hours and lab TAs.", "If you're COMPLETELY new to coding/computer science, take Donna Gabai's precepts.", "If you're interested in computer science I suggest taking the class.", "If you're struggling, there are SO many resources to help you through the course which was a great asset.  I felt somewhat neutral towards the class after having taken it but many people I know have thoroughly enjoyed it; it's all a matter of personal preference.", "It doesn't matter what you know coming in, you will learn so much and be impressed with yourself at the end.", "It is very hard to take this course without any coding background (even in the beginner precepts).  I have heard many people say they are planning on PDFing the course just to learn computer science, but I do not think that is a good idea: in order to pass the course, you still have to put in the maximum effort, which includes ~15 hours of work per week on programming assignments in addition to studying for the exams, etc. Unfortunately, this is not a good class for true beginners- it is very, very stressful and time consuming if you do not have experience.", "It's a fun and not too difficult course if you are a math-science kind of person. Expect to spend a lot of time on it between the lectures and the assignments.", "It's a great class to take for general interest, regardless of major.", "It's a great course with fun assignments.", "It's a great introduction to computer science and programming, and it is very doable for anyone of any skill level. Precepts are absolutely necessary for gaining an understanding of the material, and watching lectures is immensely helpful.", "It's a lot of work but take it anyway. It's wonderful.

It's not fun to have to go through them in the couple of weeks before an exam. Do the practice exams. Work on testing environment. The exams are high-pressure and there isn't a lot of time. I struggled a bit because it takes me a while to think things through.", "Keep up with lectures, not just with assignments, especially near the end of the course.", "Keep up with lectures.", "Keep up with the reading and lectures or you will quickly fall behind.", "Keep up with the readings and lectures, even in second semester when they have little to do with assignments.

There's no need to struggle alone, much of the course staff is willing to help.", "Make sure you have enough time for the semester. This course can be challenging and time-consuming and don't take it unless you have to or are genuinely interested.", "Make sure you keep up with the lectures because everything builds on everything else, so if you get behind then it really comes to bite you in the behind. Overall a challenging course but doable, and I had no prior experience", "My biggest regret at Princeton is that I am only taking this class as a junior.  I'm an AST major but if I had taken it freshman year I would be a COS major for sure.  This class is fantastic.  I really enjoyed every programming assignment and I thought the exams were challenging but fair.  If you are thinking about taking this course or think you might be interested in the COS major I highly recommend you do so.  I took this class even with a fair amount of programming experience already and I still learned a lot.  If you don't have any formal background you will find it helpful to learn about programming \"the right way.\"  Definitely take it!", "Not a good class to P/D/F.", "Not fun to take as a beginner.  Assignments take awhile and the lectures go over your head first time watching.", "Not too hard a class, though make sure you prepare well for the written exams.  Assignments are fun.", "Pay attention in precept! Get a good preceptor like Donna. Go to office hours if you need help. Don't fall behind on concepts, ESPECIALLY in the first few weeks. You need a solid foundation or else you will be miserable during the later difficult assignments.", "People often say that COS 126 is one of the best courses at Princeton. Yes, more than 60% of Princeton students take it. And yes, you do learn a lot from it, especially for those who have never touched a computer before. But frankly speaking, if you have no prior exposure to computer science/programming, and you do not have a close friend and/or amazing TA who can sit down with you every week to figure things out, you'll fall behind rather quickly. The programming exams are a killer when you're at the lower end of the learning curve. So take discretion. This is the class where hard work may not do it all.", "Please ask for help. My saving grace is that I have no shame to ask for help. Without that I would not have been able to pass this class.

They are really interesting even for those who learnt java and had programming experience before.", "Requires a lot of time and effort mainly to do the assignments but also if you do the readings. Don't take unless youre interested in being a cos major or really interested in cos. Its pretty hard.", "Rigorous introduction; those with no experience will learn a lot very quickly and will really benefit from taking this course.\n\nIf have programming experience you will probably find much of the course boring.  If you spend a week or two reading about computer science (object oriented programing, linked lists, stacks, queues, DFA's, turing machine, P vs NP problems) you should have enough knowledge to place right into 226 which will be more of a challenge.", "Some people get it some people don't.", "Start the assignments early on in the week and go to lab TAs if you need help.", "Start the assignments well in advance, and study for the exams far in advance too.

This is a challenging class but an incredibly rewarding one, and a must-take for every undergrad.", "Stay up to date on the reading and lectures, and start the assignments early so you have enough time if you struggle.", "Strongly recommend this course. Very accessible and there is a very strong support-network of professors, TAs and students who have previously taken the course to help.", "Study your rear off for the exams if you have no experience. You are competing with 40% of people with extensive experience and it sucks that that is true, but that is the situation.", "TAKE THIS COURSE! It is so much fun. It is challenging but also incredibly rewarding and enjoyable. It was my favorite course this semester and it has inspired me to pursue a certificate in COS.

You get out what you put in.", "Take it. Also, watch the lectures when you're supposed to. Take this course seriously. It's hard.", "Take it. Enjoy every bit of the assignments - don't be afraid to cheer out loud we you finally get your code to work! Make use of all the resources available. Take Dan's novice precept if you are new to the programming world - he will make the learning process fun. Prepare way in advance for the tests, because they are quite challenging. If you are taking this course just out of general interest, and not as a prereq, my advice is to PDF it. I didn't and deeply regret it because of the resulting stress I experienced. By PDFing, you can enjoy the course without stressing about the grade.", "Take the course and do the readings. Do not focus only on the assignments and the programming.", "Take this class if you will ever need to interact with computers in your life - which is true for everyone. If you have never experienced computer science before, it will give you a wonderful new perspective on thinking. If you have, it will only enhance that perspective.", "Take this class!!

Doug will be greatly missed, but there are other amazing preceptors like Donna (especially if you a beginner).", "Take time on the programming assignments", "The assignments are like logic puzzles, for me they were often fascinating and enjoyable while being tricky too. We were offered a variety of media through which to learn the material, which I appreciated (video lectures, textbook readings, booksite summaries and exercises, and the assignments). Don't be too hesitant to go to office hours if you're really stuck on something in an assignment, but I think it can also be enjoyable to figure stuff out for yourself.", "The class is a lot of work but it's also a lot of fun. I strongly recommend to read ahead and keep up with the lectures!", "The class is challenging but really worth taking. You will know by the end of the class if you like cos or not.

Do all the assignments early and don't procrastinate!", "This class is an excellent course to take, but definitely challenging for beginners.", "This class is definitely challenging so be prepared for the workload. I think it's worth it though so if you're just interested, you should do it.", "This class is hard and will take a lot of time, but I think it's well worth taking.", "This class is very worth it if you have never coded before, or have limited experience. I did have a fair amount of experience going in, and was told to take the class because I hadn't seen some of the theory before-as a result I didn't find the material particularly interesting or challenging for the most part. Theory was pretty much relevant for the written exams, and not anywhere else, since this is a low-level class.", "This course is a great gateway to computer science.

It gives a good basis on simple programming and also introduces issues of efficiency and performance that are very important to consider.", "This course was really hard and really time consuming (without even doing the readings and understanding material, assignments can take 10  hours per week).  It's a great way for somebody taking it for 'general interest' or as a QR to tank their GPA.  If you haven't had computer programming before, be prepared to be frustrated not only with the difficulty of the course but also with the apparent ease that those people who have already had 3 years of Java programming in high school have in doing the assignments.  Be careful with the timing of the add-drop period because the first 2 weeks of assignments are very doable introductory things and the 3rd week escalates dramatically in terms of difficulty with the NBody assignment and everything after that.  Keep in mind, all of the previous comments are coming from somebody who obviously struggled in the course--it is actually very well taught and truly exciting when you finally do get programs to work--it's a satisfaction and pride hard to find in any other class work.

Being a person who took 217 and 226 in the same semester, it is certainly not an impossible task and I do encourage others to do this to compare Java and C. However, this class is much, much harder than 217 (though not necessarily more time-consuming), contrary to popular belief, because it requires a lot more thinking and analysis and optimization -- which does not have to be a bad thing, except for the fact that there are a million and one different data structures, each with their own best and worst case running times, and then another million algorithms with obscure names, each with their own best and worst running times.

Vanderbei seemed to be making up the course as he went along, often reacting to mistakes he'd made earlier in the course (this was particularly evident in the insane variation in difficulty of the exams).

Sometimes it feels like a math class. That being said, the material is really interesting and satisfying when you get it, and it's absolutely worth it in the end.", "Chances are, you're choosing between taking qualitative quantum and quantitative quantum, aka non-math and math quantum, aka 305 vs 405. Before I begin, let me just say this: GIVE 405 A CHANCE. The fact that it is called \"Advanced Physical Chem:Quantum Mechanics\" doesn't necessarily mean that it is more advanced. In reality, it is just a different way to learn quantum. In the context in this course, it means understanding concepts using math and having a background strong in 201 and a little bit of 202. Basically, if looking at integrals doesn't summon your darkest nightmares, you are already eligible to learn a lot from this course. Some people find that they can't understand quantum at all unless it has math. If you have that background and at least tolerated it, quantum becomes extremely interesting than if you learned it qualitatively. The course, compared to 305, is in some ways harder. The problem sets are long, and they are graded based on quality unlike 305 where you just turn it in for completion (as of '15-16). And if you don't have a strong math background, you might need to spend more time getting help and building up a math foundation. However, although the exams are difficult, they aren't more difficult than 305 in terms of how well people do. You're still learning the same things in both classes. So in the end, 405 is just a different way to learn the material and you should not be scared off by it because it might be the best way you understand it. A couple of other things to note are the professor and TA. Prof. Selloni is very knowledgeable of the subject and every lecture was in my opinion paced well. She is open to answering questions asked during class, although it might be a little more difficult to feel comfortable approaching her outside of class. And for this year, we had Tia Lee aka T-God as our preceptor which is unusual for this course since it typically doesn't have enough people to warrant getting one. However, Tia was a very approachable and enthusiastic preceptor who made learning quantum more interesting and understandable in ways that lecture couldn't. Having someone readily accessible to discuss exams, psets, or to ask for help did this course a lot of justice, and I honestly do not know if the quality of the course could survive without a TA. Overall, just because it has math and has a higher catalog number and whatnot doesn't mean that it is a worse or necessarily harder class. Please consider it. Also, the textbook is the bomb and is easily readable.", "I came into this course as a Philosophy major with only MAT 201 under my belt. While it was difficult to adjust to taking a quantitative class, it proved to be extremely rewarding. The depth of understanding you receive is worth the challenge of being the \"advanced\" class. Many of my friends in 305 wished they had taken 405. My one regret is falling behind during the second half of the semester. You will get 10x more out of the class if you just are able to skim the textbook the hour or half an hour before class.", "If you want to be a physical chemist, take this.

My teacher wore Teva sandals and tie-dye shirts and would often dismiss class after fifteen minutes because he's have nothing else to say. Even still, he somehow managed to teach me physics better than this course did. Professor Visnjic was absolutely useless during lecture. She did many ridiculous demos that were fun to watch, but didn't really teach us much about physics. She would give us a narrow window of time to answer clicker questions that we had no time to process. My preceptor was equally unhelpful. He handed us a worksheet for us to complete on our own, occasionally going over a problem from the textbook requested by one of us. This was only helpful if you had already done the problem. I taught myself entirely from the help of physics major friends, McGraw, and the textbook. That is not the quality of education you expect from a school like Princeton. It is absolutely embarrassing. Sorry if you are pre-med because you have to take it. It's already terrible enough that you have to take physics, but when you lose points for stupid things like not drawing a picture of the problem when it wasn't on the question the class becomes absurd.

The labs are way better than phy 103 ones and the classes (from what I gather) are smaller and better taught.  A lot of emp students like to go on and on about how much harder it was than phy 103/mat 201 but I think that's mostly just out of pompousness (people complain about how hard their classes are as a means of bragging; if you're able to take really hard classes you must be really smart). So don't not take emp because some people scared you out of it. Sure, you might end up doing more work than in phy 103/mat 201 but it's all for good reason; you'll learn a lot from both the psets; they force you to think creatively, which is really important for engineering, even if you are never going to need to know how to calculate the average area of a triangle inscribed in a unit circle.

The content isn't much more difficult than regular PHY/MAT; you just learn a couple  of units more than they do (thermodynamics, fluid mechanics; differential equations for math).  From looking at PHY 103 problems and exams, EMP is more straightforward.  You will also have less busy work (the learning guides in EMP are so much better than PHY 103's bug ridden ExpertTA online homework).  If you're worried that you're not good enough at math and physics to take EMP over PHY 103/MAT 201, don't worry about it.  The course is taught so much more better than PHY 103/MAT 201.

Do remember that you have to take both physics and math for EMP, and the math is (purportedly) a bit harder than normal 201. However, the physics half is absolutely fantastic. The learning guides are so much better than the homework style given in normal classes, and you'll really bond with everyone else in EMP. All of the physics instructors are really great and want to see the students do well, and rocket lab is really interesting and potentially applicable to whatever field you might go into. Be wary, however, that EMP is filled with incredibly bright students, so oftentimes the curve will not be very generous. Make sure you do the readings, and keep up with the supplemental problems: you'll thank yourself come exam time.", "If you're looking for a challenge, go for EMP. AP Physics - Mechanics knowledge highly recommended. If you want higher grades and an easier workload, take MAT 201/PHY 103.

It's a lot more work than regular, but it's worth it because the material is way more interesting and the community in the class is great.", "If you're up for a challenge, EMP is a good alternative. The course moves rather quickly, so you should really keep up with the material. The rocket lab was a great experience as well. And I feel you get a better chance to bond with new friends here.", "It is a very good alternative to 103 if you don't want to suffer through boring labs.

It has completely turned me away from engineering and every single person I have talked to would have rather taken regular physics. There is no benefit to taking this class because there are no engineering applications. Don't be fooled and I would really take my word for this because once you take the class you will understand where I am coming from.

For these reasons and for the fascinating history of culture you are privy to through best-selling literature, you should definitely take this course. Be warned that the reading is often frustrating because of how simple and straightforward it is, but Professor Gleason does well in lecture to assuage your frustration and offer different ways to consider and understand these texts both in our moment and in their own moment. The central aim of this course - understanding popular texts as valuable cultural devices - is an important and refreshing way to think about literature.", "Professor Gleason is incredible. He has basically all the attributes I appreciate in a professor: approachable, charismatic while lecturing, decidedly reasonable (this is a big deal - switching our exam from the day after Dean's Date to a take-home), engaged (visiting each precept - twice), and responsive to emails. The class as a whole finds the intersection points between literature, politics, history, and social trends. It's fascinating.", "Professor Gleason is the best.

Professor Peterson can be quirky, but he does have a deep knowledge of Chinese philosophy and leads seminars in the best way that I have ever seen a seminar led. Seminars primarily involve students discussing the reading materials amongst themselves and engaging in meaningful intellectual exchanges as Professor Peterson interjects to guide and enrich the conversation while clarifying answers to questions that students pose. My main criticisms of this class are as follows: 1) A lot of material is covered, so it is difficult to dig in great depth into the subtleties of Chinese philosophy sometimes. This was actually ideal for me, as learning about Chinese intellectual history is one of my lifelong goals. So, this course provided me with a good roadmap. However, if this might be your only exposure to Chinese intellectual history, while you will probably learn a ton (given that it's an overview of something that you probably have minimal exposure to), you may find that there is a lack of depth. Then again, you may not because there is so much new information -- the experience probably varies from person to person. 2) My second issue with this course was that it seemed to be conducted from a relatively \"Western\" perspective. All readings were in English and as someone who can read Chinese, I was often surprised at the subtle discrepancies between the English translations and the original Chinese texts which would inevitably change the course of our discussions as we engaged in close readings.

However, the problems can take a while to finish when they are due so there's somewhat of a balance. People don't usually like core labs but this is one where you actually look forward to each week. It's an ideal core lab for a chem major because it touches on chemistry (solar cells, polymers), engineering, and mol/biochem (soft materials, although I'm not sure who'll be teaching it next year or after that since Saurabh is leaving).

Don't let the workload deter you from taking this course, there are a lot of readings but it's manageable, but do consider how interesting you find the material before taking this class. Some students really love it and some don't. And since it's such a big commitment make sure you're invested before you commit to it.", "Precepts: It certainly helps to read the assigned passages. :p But more seriously, try to read ahead, especially in December, because Dante is a huge block of text lol. But if you can't read it all (we feel you on Lucretius), at least skim it, and write down questions/reactions you have to the text. They don't have to be dignified or anything, my comments on Lucretius were so sassy I'm almost embarrassed to read them again. But you'll be interacting with the text, and so you'll be able to contribute in precepts.\nIt's not just about the contribution, though. Everyone in HUM has something influential or cool or insightful to say. Often it's more enjoyable to simply listen and understand what they have to say. But with a good professor (as will be the case in HUM), you can work together with your peers to draw deeper meanings from the text and get closer to the truth, which is one of the most rewarding aspects of the course. Also, you'll probably form study groups for the final this way, which is very beneficial. :p\nAs for the final, the papers prepare you for the commentary portion. For the quotes portion, honestly rereading through the texts was much better than Sparknotes. Go back through your lecture/precept notes to see which passages the professor emphasized. Look back through sections that struck you and that you commented on/highlighted. Get together with other HUMies to see what they thought key parts were, to precisely determine the style and idiosyncracies of the authors, and quiz each other beforehand. The final is ultimately a chance to show just how much you've learned in the course. It's pretty incredible to see. So to all the future HUMies, congrats. You're going to learn and do amazing things.

Please do not take this course. Don't do it or I promise you that you will regret it.", "Do not take with Guangbo. If he is teaching, just take MAT 201. This class is harder than MAT 201. Be warned.", "Do some studying and lots of practice outside of class, the course tough, but it is possible. Going to problem sessions and working with others makes it a lot more doable.", "Do the reading before lecture; it might make more sense.", "Don't fall behind. Make sure you know the concepts from week to week because they build on each other.", "Don't take if you haven't had prior experience with multivariable calculus. A challenging class but certainly interesting material if you are a math person.", "Go to the problem sessions if you don't get the psets", "Good class.", "I could go on and on about EMP and what I think about certain things, but I know that students are only going to read this review for the purpose of deciding whether to take EMP instead of phy 103/mat201, so I'll just say to go ahead and take emp. The labs are way better than phy 103 ones and the classes (from what I gather) are smaller and better taught.  A lot of emp students like to go on and on about how much harder it was than phy 103/mat 201 but I think that's mostly just out of pompousness (people complain about how hard their classes are as a means of bragging; if you're able to take really hard classes you must be really smart). So don't not take emp because some people scared you out of it. Sure, you might end up doing more work than in phy 103/mat 201 but it's all for good reason; you'll learn a lot from both the psets; they force you to think creatively, which is really important for engineering, even if you are never going to need to know how to calculate the average area of a triangle inscribed in a unit circle. And the emp lab is great. So take emp.", "I recommend taking this course over MAT201/203, especially because of the physics component, but know that the course is still difficult and moves quickly.", "I would definitely recommend taking this course. The math is not particularly integrated with the physics, but it gives an opportunity to learn these subjects alongside other engineering students, which was very enjoyable.", "I would highly suggest you try to put lectures into practice and be prepared to do a lot of example problems on your own. Quizzes and tests are difficult, but manageable with commitment.", "I would recommend this course if you are committed to engineering and you've performed well in math and physics in the past, and you're looking for a bit of a challenge. Do the readings, go to class, and try to do extra practice problems. You will only do well if you do enough problems to understand the material thoroughly.", "If you are a BSE freshman, take this instead of MAT201. Trust me, you'll have a better time. \nMultivariable is very difficult for those who are learning it for the first time. For those who have taken multi in high school, the course is still pretty hard. If you take this class, make sure that you have a solid understanding of Ch. 16 in Thomas Calculus, on the line and surface integrals. That is probably the hardest section of the course by far.", "If you didn't take Multivariable Calculus before, be ready to put a lot of effort outside the class. Try to do the readings before going to classes, because classes are more in the style of reviews of the material, especially later in the semester. So, trying to understand the material earlier would be helpful. Problem sets are doable and exams were not so bad. EMP Math has a few more extra topics than 201, but the community it creates among students is nice, and working on problem sets with other people is helpful. I would recommend you to take this class if it is a distribution requirement and if you're willing to give it the time it needs.", "If you're deciding between MAT 201 and EMP, I would go with EMP (especially for the physics lab). The lectures can be boring, but the notes are very clear.", "In my opinion, this course is more difficult than the classic Multivariable class (having switched between the two) and is certainly taught in a more engaging manner.", "In the second half of the semester, classes go pretty quickly and tend to cover a lot of material. I highly encourage reviewing the material in the textbook right after lecture to see worked out problems and reinforce concepts from class. Once you fall behind, it's not very fun. Also definitely go to the weekly problem sessions to work with others on the problem sets!", "It is a decent course.", "Lectures weren't that helpful since they cover the same thing as the book. The problem sets were very good, but the quizzes are pretty stressful.

Go to problem sessions", "Read lecture notes after going to lecture and grasp the material outside of class.", "Read the textbook and pay attention to the examples (READ READ READ!!!). Go to the weekly problem sessions for help with the problem sets.", "Start the homework early and individually. Then when you get stuck start working in groups.", "Take if you like Math a little more than average - if not, take 201. Does require some more \"Math-thinking\" and far more involved homework", "Take if you want to do the rocket lab in EGR 191. Otherwise just take MAT 201", "Take it, you'll need it for your engineering requirement and for the rocket lab.", "Take this course (and EMP as a whole) for the community and the RocketLab. The math and physics classes are no longer really integrated, so this is just a perfectly fine version of 201 - possibly a little more challenging than regular 201. Go to the lectures, go to the problem sessions, and you'll be fine.", "Taking this for a challenge isn't really worth it.  Do it for the rocket lab.", "The classes are very boring, but the material is interesting (as far as math goes) and a good challenge for freshmen who just took AP calc BC. Warning, there is NO engineering involved in the math portion of this class.", "The material is rather difficult to learn for people like me who had not taken MVC before, but going to office hours helped a lot. This class helps you meet and work with a self-selected group of BSE students because it is smaller and has more restrictive entrance requirements than MAT 201.", "The physics class paired with this (EMP 191) is great. This half of the class is quite similar to MAT201, though perhaps a bit harder. Problem sets are extremely difficult, and you will almost definitely spend hours each week at problem sessions, working with pretty much the whole class. Lectures might not actually be that helpful, as they basically cover the exact same thing as the book. Don't fall behind, because it will be extremely hard to move on if you don't fully understand the parts that came before. A warning that many of the kids in this class have already taken multivariable calc, or are just naturally amazing at math, so if you aren't good at math, the curve will likely not be kind.", "The way the course was this year, taught by Professur Xu, I thought it was appalling in terms of teaching quality. In retrospect, I would have been better off skipping class and self-studying from the internet. I'm sure it covered all the multivariable calculus we'll need in the future and to an adequate depth, but these days you can get that information from anywhere and I really would have expected a higher level of attention to pedagogy at a university like this.", "The whole EGR 191/192 course does not integrate math and physics at all even though the impression was given that it would.  You might as well take math 201 so you can have more people to study and work on problem sets with.", "This class wasn't what I'd call enjoyable, but it was well taught and basically what I would expect from a math class. As far as I know, it wasn't worse than 201, so if you have to take math and physics, I'd recommend taking EMP just because the physics lab is really great.", "This course is not good. It was incredibly challenging and the teaching wasn't good. You mostly have to teach yourself. It was worth it to take because you can take the EGR 192 Physics class with it, which is very interesting. Prepare for a lot of work in this class without a lot of understanding.", "This course is very challenging, especially for those with minimal experience with multivariable calculus. The material is rather difficult, but if you're willing to invest a lot of time and effort to get through the class, do consider taking it.", "This was an incredible experience, not just for the more personalized learning, but also because it is easy to become very good friends with the other students that you will meet.\nProfessor Guangbo is an extremely well structured lecturer with clear lecture notes.

Definitely more work in the second half of the semester, as you have longer lab/programming assignments. While at the beginning, the labs feel a little irrelevant or disconnected from what you're learning, the skills you build in the earlier labs are important for being able to successfully complete the later, longer lab assignments.

In particular, this course builds from transistors all the way up to assembly (and a little bit of C, in examples), which was really cool.\n\nHowever, I personally wasn't a huge fan of the presentation of the material. Be prepared for a lot of tracing through designs in lecture, some tedious problems on PSETs (which I personally don't think helped me understand the material better), and possibly feeling like the grading system is not entirely fair (sometimes, it seems like they're looking for the answer in the key and won't give much partial credit to answers that don't adhere closely to the one they're looking for).\n\nProfessor Malik is very kind, though, and it seems like he cares a lot about helping students learn the material.

Gave great lectures (some of the best I've attended at Princeton) and somehow he managed to learn the names of all his students by the end of the semester. The class is a great introduction to more rigorous math for people who haven't really done that before (of course nowhere near the rigor of a math course) and developed a fair bit of mathematical maturity. Overall great class, definitely recommend. Much better taught than ORF 307 (like seriously so much better taught) and covers similar material, so if you're not an ORF major, maybe take this course instead (or if one day this becomes an alternative to 307 in the ORFE core, take it).", "Best ORF class ever.

Professor Ahmadi is great and you'll get a lot out of it, regardless of what major you are.", "Dr. Ahmadi is an excellent professor. Well organized, very considerate, and makes sure students are managing the class. With any other professor, the material itself could easily go over people's heads, but he handles the presentation of it with great effort. Make sure you are comfortable with linear algebra. MATLAB can be picked up. The Psets can be a bit tedious at times, but you get to work in groups and they always explain the tough parts at office hours. Take it over ORF307 if you have the option to. This is the superior optimization class.", "Great class for cos and optimization! Professor is amazing!", "Great class on optimization.

AAA is a fantastic professor, the material is interesting, and the assignments and exams are very fair. There is no textbook - instead, you'll be reading AAA's notes, which mirror exactly what he teaches in lecture and are very well put together. Assignments are long-ish but doable, especially if you start early and work with friends. The math isn't super hard either as long as you know your linear algebra (don't worry, the entirety of lecture #2 is a math review). Don't be afraid to ask questions in class.

Despite what the name of this course may lead you to believe, this is not a \"soft\" course, and you will be expected to do real proofs starting from from the very first problem set. Don't worry though if you don't have any background with proofs - Professor Ahmadi or his TAs always there to help you out and give you some guidance during office hours, of which there are many throughout the week. You will also be doing some really cool computational exercises, and you will leave the class with an extremely solid understanding of convex analysis, optimization, and some of their applications.", "Probably the best ORFE class I've taken at Princeton (I'm an orf major). Prof. Amirali is extremely approachable and really cares for his students. I liked that he tried to make the problem sets focus more on applications, although there were theory and proof questions too (what do you expect for an orf class?). Lecture notes were well organized. The concepts are more manageable than other more theory heavy orf classes (there's many non-orf students who take the course). It wasn't until I was studying for the take-home final that I realized how much I learned in this class and I wish I kept up a bit more during the semester.

When I was finished, I felt like I had learned a lot of useful information--about both optimization and fields related to it--and like I'd actually retain it, too.

Don't hesitate. ^_^ Prof. Ali is incredible, and the hmwrks are time consuming, but not as bad as 309.", "This is such a wonderful class. It would be a great experience for someone interested in OR concepts to get their first experience and it's a moderately easy class for someone who is well versed in ORF and wants to enhance their mathematical/theoretical grasp on the concepts they have learned. All the support and guidance by instructors makes it very easy to follow and stay afloat.", "This is the best class I have taken at Princeton.  Professor Ahmadi is absolutely fantastic and knows how to teach the harder concepts in the class very well.  I did not have a strong math background going into the class, so some of the proofs were difficult for me, but he was understanding of this and really helped me learn them well.  The TAs were phenomenal, as well.  Overall, a wonderful experience.", "This must be one of the best taught courses at Princeton, largely because AAA is an exceptional lecturer. The optimization applications are far-reaching, and you learn to use very simple software that is very powerful. Background using Matlab is very helpful. This course is a must-take for anyone interested in anything related to optimization.", "You learn what you put in to this class really. Though putting in an effort in this class is made really easy by the high quality lectures and lecture notes, responsive course staff, helpful office hours, and a professor/head preceptor who actually care about your happiness in the class as a student.

The junior seminar is a requirement for the history department. Taking it with Professor Greene was both an intimidating and good experience. There seemed to be a lot more reading than in other seminars but it made for a good course overall. Greene is very open to students in office hours; take advantage of that.", "The history of disease is fascinating, and if you are interested in taking a stab at history of science or an interdisciplinary history tact, then you would benefit from this course.

Eventually, you'll probably just have to step back and stop reading. But, you can generally make it through precepts and essays without reading everything. But again, the reading load is quite overwhelming. Essays are graded pretty easily, though. And the midterm exam was very easy.

Other than that, this is a relatively fun course with controversial topics that is pretty easy to follow with minimal knowledge of Christianity (it's a course for everyone for sure).", "Definitely take it, regardless of your religion. You'll see how much diversity there is within Christianity--for me, it was encouraging seeing that there is so much disagreement, because it gives you an opportunity to really determine what you think with the help of so many different and interesting arguments. Reading very reasonable in first half of semester, picks up in second half but still not terrible.", "Definitely take. The course is kind of rushed, but it will make you think about Christianity and religion and ethics in general in a different way, regardless of your background. Gregory is a great lecturer. Not too hard a class, either.", "Do all the readings. Find a good preceptor. Go to all the lectures!", "Go to lectures", "Good class.

You will definitely think in new ways and have your views challenged, so that is great. On the other hand, there is a lot of reading and not all of it is totally great.", "I took this to fulfill an EC however this quickly became one of my favorite courses I have taken at Princeton. Whether you are Christian or not it is taught in a way that encourages you to think deeply about your own personal values and the reasons you have them.", "I very strongly recommend this course if you are interested in learning how Christian beliefs from a variety of backgrounds and denominations (from Catholicism to Evangelicalism) interact with each other and also with society. It was fascinating for me and the authors were really cool.\nThe exams were definitely reasonable with a lot of choice, as were the 2 essays, so I think this is a great class to take where you can learn about a great many things but also focus on your interests for graded work.", "I would advise against PDFing this course if you want to get the most out of it. You may be able to pass just by skimming all the readings the night before an exam (and there is a temptation to do this if you PDF), but if you do that, you won't have a chance to reflect and let the material challenge your worldview.", "I would definitely recommend this course.

If you are a hardcore atheist, you will find this class incredibly frustrating, but it's worth taking anyways. In general, take it if you have the time to read a TON and think deeply about it.", "If you really just want a distribution requirement and are interested in the material, take it.

You will learn so much about complicated moral issues, regardless of what religious background you come from.", "Take this course. Fantastic, and no need to PDF.", "This class is about why you're here taking classes like this, and you should take this class to find out for yourself.", "This class is fine, but a bit reminiscent of high school. I don't think I got a deeper idea of any concept from this course. I was a little disappointed given how excited I was coming in.", "This class is unlike any other at Princeton and is one that all students here should take - Christian or non-Christian. You will think differently about some things if you choose to open your eyes to the many other perspectives that this class introduces. I loved it.", "This course is a great course to take if you are interested in reading a lot of different sources on Christian ethics, and then hearing a great lecture on the material. The lectures are entirely worth coming to,", "This course is really well designed. It provides a good framework to critically reflect on your personal ethics (definitely worth spending at least a course on during college, whether this course or another).", "This is a lot of reading. Like insane amounts. Be warned. but it is quite eye-opening and really makes one think.", "This is a pretty easy course for PDF and the papers and final are not too terrible!", "This is a really good course.

There is not a lot of work besides that though.", "This was a cool course, but don't try and do all the readings, its unrealistic!", "This will give you a great ability to enter into very informed dialogue on essentially all current moral/legal debates, whether you're a Christian or not. I'm really glad I took it.", "Try to keep up on the reading, go to precept and try to go to lecture and you will be fine. Interesting opportunity to think about why you have stances on certain issues, decent 5th class", "Very interesting course, can seem a little hard to grasp without a great understanding of Christianity though.", "While it is true that the reading for this course is a lot and easily piles up, the overall quality of this course is too good to pass up. Gregory's lectures are very good, and the readings are extremely applicable to life outside of academics. Grade-wise, I don't think that it is too hard to get an A in this class (coming from a liberal arts major).", "While the content in this course would historically have taken up a series of courses, the University has seen fit to relegate the whole of Christian moral thought to this one course. While Prof. Gregory does an excellent job, evidently only a few hours a week for a semester does not do the class justice; there could be a full class taught on any of the major topics, which ranged from Just War to sexuality. Though I don't know whether this was intended, the course has also helped me jettison my attachment of philosophical liberalism and democracy to Christianity as well as helping me to evaluate secularism as its own ideology and type of religion.", "YES!

Also Francisco's an incredible preceptor, he really knows the material and is passionate about the class!

Workload is very, very manageable (I took this as a 5th), especially because YOU CAN SCHEDULE WHICH WEEK TO WRITE YOUR ESSAYS.

Unfortunately, she is diligent on attendance, so there is no way to avoid it.", "The obligatory lecture attendance was a bit annoying at times.

The definition of \"growing up global\" is broad and inclusive, so if you're interested in taking this course, definitely take it without worrying if you'll \"fit in.\" Get Brittney Edmonds as your preceptor if you can", "This class is super duper easy and chill. Just make sure you come to class and consider the ability to redo your essays. If you want an easy A and need to fulfill your EM, look no further.", "This course is okay. The lectures always go over the same things and you have to attend them for your grade. Self-assigned deadlines are good, but the book you read that week might not be interesting. The general view taken in the class can be very America-centric, which can make you feel more alienated, ironically. Put effort into your critical papers and creative narrative and you should be fine if you want to take it.", "This is a good course, and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to read a bunch of fantastic books I wouldn't have otherwise (or, at least, having been exposed to books I'll return to in the future). Professor Belcher's lectures tend to be a bit more didactic and moralizing than I'd like, and she avoids going into great depth about the books presumably because students will have to present on the readings in precept. Lecture attendance is also very closely graded, so if you don't like them, you still have to sit through them. But overall, it was still a fairly pleasant way to pick up an EM.", "This is a great EM to take. There are two critical papers (you can choose which weeks/readings to write on), one final personal narrative, and one creative project. The courses requires some self-reflection especially for the final paper. It's also a very \"literature\" course in that you read into details that may not have even been the author's intended meaning. I personally didn't like all the books, but they were all good reads despite my final review of them. It was also nice to enjoy novels/memoirs from this class to balance out critical/scientific readings from other courses. Make sure to go to all lectures and precepts though; attendance is key.", "This is a great course, not a huge workload, but really engaging material and genuinely made me reflect on myself in a way that no other course has.", "This is a very interesting course.", "Very easy class, generously graded, and very light workload. Great to pdf, but you can probably get an A of some kind with just a bit more effort.", "Visit the writing center as much as you can. They are really good at helping out.", "Wendy is a fantastic person and professor. Even if you don't think of yourself as transnational, this class is excellent to learn about different perspectives and experiences and reflect on your own life.", "Wonderful course with a great professor and instructors, if you keep up with the material you will enjoy the class immensely.", "Worth the easy A to show up to Belcher's uber boring lectures, but you will definitely grit your teeth through the semester and the precepts.", "aaa.\nProf Belcher: So, lectures-wise, it can get pretty boring. And she takes attendance in lectures, which count for a major part of your grade, so no skipping lecture. That being said, it's easy to fall asleep in lecture, but you're not missing much if you do. Not a bad professor, just talks monotone and super-slow in lecture. Also makes provocative points that you will be sure to disagree with.\nReadings: are very good. I personally enjoyed reading every page of these readings. There are a lot of books, but don't be intimidated by the list. One of them is a movie, another is a graphic novel. And you only really need to read in-depth for 2 of them, for the 2 essays you write.\nCritical Essays: You write 2. One in first 6 weeks, another in last 6 weeks. You get to pick the reading you write it on, so do read ahead to see what's the best book to write on. You want to analyze a short story of 250 pages of reading? My preceptor was a lenient grader for me (or really liked my writing, but I don't consider myself an excellent writer). 5-6 pages, double-spaced. Standard stuff.\nCreative Essay: You write 1. >12 pages, no max limit. Really fun project, getting to explore yourself and understand who you really are. It's open-ended, in the construction of a memoir.\n\nOverall: A great class. Lectures are mandatory (count for a substantial portion of your grade), can be a bit boring.

You must commiserate as a whole in order to survive. Make sure to manage your time well, ask a lot of questions.", "Okay, so you're taking chem core lab. This core lab is the second worst core lab on campus (save CBE - though this has been debated...). BUT you have two of the nicest professors on this campus - really, they are absolutely great :D And as always, the chem lab TAs are superb. Manage your time well i.e. start the reports early and work with other people. It'll be a rough semester, but you really learn so much and get exposed to 2/3 of the rest of chemistry (not orgo).", "Overall, I am very glad I took this course for the things I learned, the people I met, and the insight I gained about how to do research. I think that the lab skills and research skills I gained were very important for any chem major to know, and I did learn a great deal in a short amount of time.\nThat being said, I cannot give a blanket recommendation because this class also completely took over my life the first half of the semester, and made weekly all-nighters (without procrastination) a thing. Do not take this class if you plan to have several other high-demand classes this semester plus significant extracurriculars. I would very very strongly advise one of the other core labs in that case. This core lab ended up being worth it for me, but I do not think it is for all situations.\n\nHowever, if you do decide to take this class, I highly advise that you get comfortable with Excel right now (tricks for formulas, mins/maxes, etc.) because you will use it a lot for large amounts of spectral data. In addition, look for the chemistry research guide with the Princeton University Library. The lab reports will require significant amounts of outside research (very different from orgo lab reports), and this site can link you to a lot of helpful places. Lastly, study with the other chem core labe people! I think this the thing I value the most from this class--the bonds built during the late nights writing lab reports.  Have dance breaks every once in a while in those nights, and know that it will be okay! The exams are okay--study what you learned in lectures and be able to explain the concepts.\n\nTo give a rough idea of what it will be like-the lab reports took me an average of 25 hours to write (there are 4 in the first 6 weeks) and the longest one took 40 hours. It really is a lot, so plan your semester accordingly.", "So what the heck is core lab? Core lab is essentially the closest thing Princeton will have to an analytical chemistry course. The course is best described as a \"crash course\" in many practical topics of chemistry, with lab sections to help you learn things hands-on. But as the nature of crash courses go, you tend to learn a lot while understanding a little. The lectures are generally fast paced, and some of the topics aren't easy to learn. The labs are interesting and you get to work with partners, but the lab reports and analysis also takes a lot of time. The criteria for grading isn't entirely well defined, and neither is the feedback. On the other hand. I found that a lot of learning comes from doing assignments (or \"doing\" things) than from sitting in one place and listening. All things considered, may sound really appealing to some of you, and for some of you it may not. But chances are, many of you have no other choice. If you're one of those people, it is definitely true that it is a lot of work and the negative reputation of the class probably stems from this. However, it definitely it tolerable. You'll learn a lot regardless of how well you end up doing in the class, and the most important skill to have to do well is persistence.", "Start lab reports early. Strongly recommend for Chemistry majors.", "Take this course (you probably have to, anyway).  It entails an incredible amount of work, but you will learn so much.  The first half of the course is spent on four labs, and it is probably the more challenging portion because of the sheer length of the lab reports.  Start early and work together.  (The second half is spent on an independent project and material on instrumentation and statistics, but I found this part to be much more manageable.)", "The lab reports are terrible though the independent work is interesting. There are no practice exams so this class.", "This class could easily be entitled 'Miscellaneous Chemistry' instead of 'Experimental Chemistry'; there are lots of disparate (though more-often-than-not important) elements, and it requires a ton of time.", "This class is notorious for it's HUGE workload and difficulty. The reputation is pretty accurate. BUT it is also one of the most interesting and useful courses I've taken at Princeton. The research tools you learn about are important for most areas of chemistry and you will be exposed to different areas of inorganic and physical chemistry. The course is very much front-loaded, so after fall break, it slows down a bit. Stay on top of your work throughout the semester and plan to spend 25-35 hours on lab reports weekly/bi-weekly. It is a lot of work, but I think it's very valuable work. ENJOY!", "This course is a non-stop thrill ride for the first 6-7 weeks. At any given point, you could be desperately trying to complete the current lab report (which may take 20-40 hours depending) while you're collecting data for the next lab report. Plus, the course has two lecture periods and two lab periods, so you'll spent a lot of time in class, but you'll spend far more time out of class working on the reports. Also, there are lengthy problem sets which may be due at the same time as the lab report. There are no breaks, so just buckle down for a couple months and try to steadily chip away at the lab reports.", "Very difficult but you learn a lot.", "You have to take this course.

It'll change the way you view biology, and there's very little memorization (as opposed to MOL214). The topics we covered answered the conceptual questions AP Bio was never able able to cover, and we use a quantitative approach to learning interesting and relevant topics. Celeste Nelson is hilarious!! Take it (even if you're a little worried about your GPA).", "Don't bother doing readings, they really are just for reference and if you've taken a biology course in high school, you're totally set.

Take it if you can!", "I would not take this course-- it's intriguing but not an efficient way to learn biology (which would be MOL 214).

Realize its more math than biology pretty much. Nice because no memorization, but you really have to keep up with the work!", "It is not true that you do not have to memorize a lot of biological concepts for this course. You still do. However, you also learn more quantitative approaches in biology which are very interesting and not trivial. If you have taken AP Bio before, it is not really necessary to get the textbook as the tests are mainly based off of lecture, but the book is a good reference. Make sure to go to all of the lectures and take detailed notes. Unfortunately, you aren't given a lot of practice problems for the quantitative portions of the exams so you really need to make sure you understand them. The labs are really fun and the lab reports are pretty short as you only have to answer analysis questions instead of doing a formal write-up.", "No memorization as promised but the course is not well organized.

Learn about lots of interesting research findings. Labs can be long and frustrating. Exams are somewhat hard to study for but not terrible.", "Take it. Don't take MOL 214.", "Take this course. If you are deciding between 214 and 215, go with 215. The lectures are memorable and the whole class is more tightly knit.", "This course covers information in AP Biology and adds math. This is a fun and interesting course for students fairly advanced in math who have not taken advanced biology.", "This course is exactly what it intends to be - that is not so much a biology course as an applied math course also dealing in lab procedure. If considering to take it instead of 214, know that there is very little interchangeable between the two. 215 seems to relish it's differences. That is to say you will not be tested much on anything that a traditional biology class would test you on - there is very little memorizing or acquisition of systems here. Instead, most problems are mathematically based and merely displayed in the trappings of biology (a good example would be using Michaelis-Menten as it relates to enzyme kinetics). Therefore, you should be confident in your math abilities. Certainly do not take this class as a test-run or a dalliance because it generally harbors a mix of future med-students and chemical engineers stuck here by requirement who will no doubt breeze through what the casual dilettante might find impenetrable.", "This course is extremely underrated. It is instructed very competently, and much of the material past the first couple weeks is highly interesting. This class will make you think like a scientist, and not expect tons and tons of memorization like 214. Take this class.", "This course is far more interesting than MOL 214 and requires less memorization, I would take this instead if precalc-level math doesn't faze you.", "This is a fantastic and interesting course for those interested in getting a taste of the computational side of biology.

If you enjoy math at all, this is a great course to start of your study of Biology", "This is such an interesting, easy class.

Got to the point where few people showed up in lecture and texted their friends if there was going to be a quiz at the end. What kind of didactic purpose is such a system serving?

Over the course of the semester, I have endured a great deal and I hope to make sure that no one decides to take this course in it current state.\n\nFirst, let me discuss the organization of the course. Programming and written assignments were a mess, with students needing to thoroughly use Piazza to even begin to understand what the questions asked.\n\nProgramming assignments were long and tedious, and after you finish the time-consuming coding, you have to write a long-detailed report which does absolutely nothing to enhance learning, it just takes up more time that you could be using more productively.\n\nGrading was arbitrary as well, you could put in as much time as your peers and turn in a similar assignment but each grader would grade each assignment differently. You never know what you would get, and I felt like every week I had to trek to Nassau Street to get Xiaoyan Li to correctly grade my problem sets and quizzes. \n\nLectures were quite literally the worst things I have ever listened to in my life. Somehow, each lecturer was worse than the last. Xiaoyan Li tried, was at times confusing but she still tried. Seung didn't even try, and quite frankly came off as cold and pretentious. Hazan was impossible to understand, and even more impossible to follow and learn from.\n\nIf there is one thing I leave you with, let it be this: save your semester. You only get 4 years here, do not spend your valuable time slaving over this awful, awful course. If you're interested in AI, don't take this class. COS424   ORF418 should give you plently of knowledge, and I know first hand each of those classes are much better than COS402.", "I thought the problem sets and class material is fascinating but the lecturing could have been better.

The course is not too terrible, is a decent amount of work, but until the lectures get better, I would wait.", "Take this course. Very cool material, very cool assignments, but very bad lectures. Hopefully by next year they will have found a good lecturer, but until then, expect to do all the learning by yourself.", "The class is a lot of work. The frequency of assignments is really high, so you'll find yourself working on some 402 assignment pretty much every week. The lectures are really useless - the professors like to derive and write out tons of equations that don't actually help you see the concepts. You quickly get lost during lecture and stop paying attention. Thankfully, everything the professors say in lecture is covered in the textbook. Most people just read the textbook to get by in the class. The programming assignments of decently cool. I'm kind of ambivalent about whether to recommend the class. Just beware that it is a lot of work and very poorly run. Grading can be pretty arbitrary as well for assignments. Different TAs give very different grades.", "The content is probably among the most useful concepts I learned about since COS 226. It does require a lot of time (weekly assignments), so treat it as one of your main classes.", "The good: the material you learn in this course is extremely interesting. If you study the book well and put good effort into the assignments, you'll get a lot out of this course. The TAs are helpful during office hours. For the most part, the textbook (Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach) and supplemental reading are great resources. \n\nThe bad: Lectures are bad. This is a well known fact from previous iterations of this course. At first you have Xiaoyan Li, who is mediocre, and you wish for someone better. Then Xiaoyan stops lecturing and you're given the opportunity to experience the wonders of Elad Hazan and Sebastian Seung. At this point, you start to regret wishing away Xiaoyan and hope she comes back soon. \n\nThe ugly: Course administration is a mess. Expect to get your grades back 2 weeks later and with a randomly assigned score somewhere around a predefined median. Then check the Piazza for instructions on how to get your randomly graded assignment \"regraded\". This time, get an actual grade with one point deducted because the TA is spiteful that you wasted his time.\n\nGeneral recommendation: expect a mess in terms of lecturing and course organization. But if you really enjoy the material (as I did), this course is still worth taking. You can learn a lot. But you must put in the effort yourself. Do not expect the lectures to help you.", "The lectures were mediocre, the few lecture slides posted weren't useful for outside study, and practically no reference solutions, examples, or notes were provided. The assignments weren't too hard, but they were due weekly, including immediately after breaks (and two during reading period).", "The lectures, especially later in the year are usually not worth going to.

Overall, enjoyable content to learn.", "Xiaoyan Li is the worst lecturer at Princeton. Fascinating subject material, but she manages to take a very interesting class and make it terrible. I beseech the department to replace her as professor for this course.", "take it but find other ways to learn the material because the lecturers aren't great", "tl;dr-Don't take this course unless they drastically change it\n\nThis course is a disaster. Below are the reasons why.\n\n1) There is an assignment *every* *single* *week*. Thanksgiving break? Assignment due the day we get back. Two weeks off for Winter Break? Two assignments due during the week we get back. Working on and worrying about assignments during breaks is something that is so quintessential to the Princeton experience, but it doesn't have to be, and it shouldn't be. This class was the main contributor to making breaks feel like continuations of the semester.\n2) We never get told the right answers to assignments. Thus, since we don't get the answers afterwards, there is no way to learn and grow from mistakes on problem sets. This likely stems from laziness and lack of trust on the end of the professors--they don't want to give out the answers so they can reuse the same problem sets every year. Using the same problem sets every year is fine, but not when it comes at the expense of student learning.\n3) There were nearly no materials to study for the final exam. We got one practice test, but (I kid you not) only got the answers to half of it. Taking practice tests for a final is usually how material is consolidated and reinforced, but this was not an option for this course. They didn't even release a study guide telling us which concepts were important to review. This also probably stems from laziness--the professors want to keep on using the same exam each year, so they don't give out any practice exams, which causes students to get less out of the course.\n4) The lectures are bad. Very bad. A good professor should have the ability to take a difficult concept and explain it in simple terms. A decent professor should have the ability to take a simple concept and explain it in simple terms. The professors of this course could do neither.\n\nThere are many more reasons why this course was terrible, but I think you get the point by now.\n\nIn conclusion, take literally any other computer science course over this one."], "area": "", "ratings": [["Lectures", "Readings", "Papers, Reports, Problem Sets, Examinations", "Overall Quality of the Course", "Feedback for other students"], [2.79, 3.34, 3.18, 2.77, 3.14]], "prereqs": "COS 226.", "descrip": "The fundamental principles, algorithms and techniques of modern artificial intelligence research and practice.

Sure, she's incredibly nice and interesting to talk to on matters of policy and real-world happenings, but in an intro economics class like this, the line between learning the technical foundations for economics and motivating that technical knowledge through real world policy conversations was simply nonexistent. This, when done correctly, would've been fantastic. However, lectures (of course, in my opinion) were very difficult to follow and stay engaged in, as they usually randomly took tangents (mind you, planned tangents on the slides but still tangents nonetheless) to matters of policy when more confusing topics like monetary vs. fiscal policy were barely covered. Often, Bogan would just say \"you should know this, it's in the book,\" and would completely skip over it during lecture. While classes shouldn't be taught 100% \"to the textbook\" as they often were in high school, they also shouldn't completely depend on it, to the point that if you didn't read you wouldn't get anything out of lecture. The least lectures could've done is hit the highlights, explain some concepts further, and then motivate those concepts through discussion of policy.

Workload/exams weren't too bad at all.", "ORF 309 is a solid introduction to probabilistic thinking and I strongly recommend this course to any student in any department; that sort of mindset is quite enlightening. Moreover, Prof. van Handel's lectures and course notes are among the best I've experienced at Princeton, so the material is really made quite approachable for students of all backgrounds. This course isn't as challenging as some students make it out to be; just pay attention in lecture and work out the problems on the problem set yourself.", "Please don't take without prior probability knowledge. You are at an extreme disadvantage when you don't know notation.", "Probability is a branch of mathematics that many students shy away from him because it is known to be notoriously hard. When I entered ORF 309 on the first day, I hated probability with a passion. But in the journey that Ramon took us on during the semester, through Poisson processes and random walks, through Brownian motion and Markov Chains, suddenly my hatred for probability began to turn into something pinker. Staying up until all hours working on the 5-question problem sets were enjoyable, and even though tears, red bull, and coffee stains accompanied the B I G H O M E W O R K I turned in (which takes at least 30 hours to complete, even though it is 18 questions with Ramon), I relished the pain of chugging through jointly Gaussian random variables and proving their independence. Ramon has a very remarkable way of presenting material in class that turns every student's mathematical nightmare into something beautiful. Make no mistake -- this class will consume you and your life and can easily become one of the top two classes you spend most of your time on, but after all, no pain no gain, and when you leave this class, you will have an intuition for probability and a new way of looking at the world.

Ramon is super cool.", "Take this course if you enjoy thinking about challenging ideas.", "Taken this course if you want an interesting challenge", "Takes lots of time but also Ramon is amazing.", "The course is well taught, but challenging and requires a lot of time and effort. It is much more effective to work in groups than to struggle individually, and definitely go to office hours as much as possible to complete the problem sets and to study for the exams.", "The topics covered are really interesting and lectures are good, but psets take a lot of time and the rest of the class structure could be improved.", "This class has set the bar for how well material should be taught, how charismatic and engaging professors here can be, and how rewarding a course at Princeton can be. Ramon is such an amazing professor. I am not ORFE, but after taking this class I wish I were. I think all engineers (and other people who use probability) should take this class for the 300-level math requirement. It is challenging but you will learn so much and you will develop an understanding of probability that cannot be gained elsewhere. Truly a standout class for Princeton. Take it!", "This class is everything", "This class is great, but it is a lot of work for a \"for-fun\" class.  I'd advise taking it in a four class semester if you can.  It's definitely useful stuff and you will be a lot more confident about probability afterwards.", "This course is very time-consuming and difficult. However, you would feel like you learned a lot at the end of the semester.", "This course was extremely difficult and although I will end up with a crappy grade, I don't regret taking this course. The material was very interesting. My only concern is the difficulty of some of the problem sets. They were IMPOSSIBLE for me to do on my own. You pretty much need a group to do them with unless you're a genius. With that said, Ramon is a cool dude that knows his stuff, and he will teach you a ton of fascinating things about probability by the end of the course.

Prepare to be thoroughly challenged by the material through weekly problem sets, especially by the extra long Dean's Date assignment.", "This is a great course. Difficult and fun, gives a good background in probability. Ramon is a wonderful lecturer and very humorous. Office hours are frequent and helpful for understanding the problem sets ? I highly recommend going to them. If you find one AI isn't helpful in office hours, go to a different one's (or ideally Ramon's).", "This is a really well-taught course that poses interesting problems and will teach you to think probabilistically.", "This is an amazing class - I think it's one of the most interesting and well taught quantitative classes offered here. Professor van Handel is a great lecturer and makes the material incredibly relevant. Given that, it's a really tough class, and the problem sets and exams are hard. I think it's worth it though!", "This is an amazing class, Ramon is THE BEST LECTURER. This is the only class ever that I have been excited to attend lecture for. As an econ major, I took this class for the stats certificate but recommend for anyone remotely interested in probability. You will learn so much. That being said, it is a very difficult class...prepare to put a lot of time into it, and for math majors to destroy the curve.", "This is an amazing course, that has extraordinary professors and preceptors. They all take the time to help you navigate this difficult course. The problems sets are extremely hard and take a long time, but there are ample opportunities for help. I would definitely recommend this course if you are strong with math/calculus.", "This is one of the best courses at Princeton, in large part due to Ramon. Problem sets can be challenging at times, but the class is manageable.", "This is the best course I've taken at Princeton so far. Professor van Handel explains concepts very clearly, so you never feel lost in lecture (even though the concepts can get relatively involved), and he has a very engaging/humorous lecture style.

Taking multivariable calculus alongside is particularly useful.", "From what I've found with the high drop rate (I am dropping the course for the next semester myself), this course is best for people who like physics and biology equally. The labs are more biology-oriented (all of my bio-loving friends loved labs), while the theoretical content is more physics-oriented. Even so, while I loved thermodynamics and statistical mechanics (how many physics freshmen can say they've learned that?), I do think that students who are strongly leaning one way or the other do miss out on a lot of important topics. With the lack of actual chemistry (particularly in the first half of the course) combined with the deeper coverage of few areas (I basically only remember doing oscillations, energy conservation, drag forces, and stat mech / thermo as physics topics all of first semester), this course is best suited for those who have already done well in all of the AP science classes. Otherwise you'll miss out on a lot of foundational topics, such as dynamics. Apparently my bio friends say the coverage of bio topics is sorely lacking as well. And if you're looking for chemistry, take something else. This isn't the place to really get it.

It is difficult, and if you take it you won't have much free time, unless you are good at time management and start everything early. If you take this course, I would highly recommend reading all the lecture notes, possibly before lectures, and going to office hours. You will probably end up with a close group of fellow ISC students. You will often feel like you don't understand the material in lectures, precepts, exams and problem sets (luckily the problem sets are mostly collaborative). You will get to cover topics that freshman rarely cover, e.g Statistical Mechanics. The labs are really cool and the lab reports are strenuous (they usually take 20  hours to complete, start them early!).

(If this was a house and i was a realtor looking to unload it on some sentimental chump.)\nThe Lectures are top notch, but very fast. It is like a stream of crash courses in the sciences with (excellent) professors trying to cram their brains into your brains for two and a half weeks, and then leaving. \nThe physics lectures are epic, and Professor Gregor knows it. They have storylines, characters, and deeply satisfying climaxes. The use of the chalkboard is top notch, and the overall aesthetic of the instructor's clothing (esp The Glove) inspires confidence. Stimulating? I was stimulated. \nOften the material was very complex, and took a while to digest, but it was art. Art is complex. Art is disturbing. It is controversial. It is raw.  How does that make you feel?\n\nA quote from the Registrar:\n \"Reading/Writing assignments:\nReading, problem sets and lab reports totaling 10-15 hours each week will be assigned. See instructors for required reading and texts.\"\n\n^^ This is not true. Each problem set can take that long, and the labs can take almost twice as long at first. There are also COS assignments that can take around that long by themselves. So in the end, if you add it all up, it will take up all of your time, all the time. \n \nWhat is the payoff? \nThe class is awesome. it is an \"interdisciplinary way of teaching science, based in the application of mathematical models\" (or something like that) - but what does that mean? Is there something more than that? It may teach you to think, eat, sleep, and feel like a scientist. it may not. but it WILL make you think about science while you eat and sleep. It is a character building experience. It makes you question the purpose of your life, the value in doing work, and ask questions like \"if all i do with my time is ISC, and i don't know what ISC is doing to improve my time, then am i wasting my life?\" These are fascinating questions that can really shape your psychological development and stability for your whole life. \nThe labs are awesome. TOP NOTCH. This is where I understood what was presented in lecture. In lecture, your mind gets blown off, then in the PSet it gets knocked around a bit, and then in the lab and lab report, you spend like 30 hours or so putting it back together (fairly well, not quite the way it was) with the new information in it. \nThe support system is impressive. Between the lecturers, preceptors, lab people, tutor people, there are lots of resources. And the students help each other out and are a great community of people who now have a shared history of common adversity. Which is super helpful in creating a sense of unity.\n\nDon't worry! you will smile again!

Few other classes have the same sense of community.\n\nDespite these pros, however, there are glaring shortcomings to the structure of HUM. The most obvious limitations are on how much time we were able to spend on each work. There are 2 80-minute precepts per week, the second of which is supposed to cover all of what was discussed in the Wed/Thurs lectures (key word supposed to).

The professors are totally willing to just talk about passages you liked, or to try to draw out a vague idea you keep having, or to comment on an outline you've made if you're that far along. I repeat, you /do not/ have to have a rough draft 'prepared' for the professor when you go to office hours before the essay is due (unless they specifically ask for it, in which case, that's annoying, go to a different professor). If you're writing a philosophy paper, meet with the philosophy professor (whether they're your grader or not) before it's due /and/ after you've received feedback, to see how you can improve. Also note that with a philosophy paper, it will probably help to be more explicit/redundant than normal, e.g. use signposting: First, I consider X. ... Having seen that X is true, we now turn to Y. etc.\nIn general, it is very beneficial to meet with at least one professor both before and after your paper is due.\nDo your best to do all the readings; certain weeks, like the one with Dante, will be overloaded, so start on those readings earlier. But don't beat yourself up about not finishing a reading, talk to friends about it and ask them what they thought was cool/surprising/interesting about it.\nFinally (sorry for the excessive post lol), enjoy your time in the course. The people around you--professors, staff, classmates--are amazing and have their own insights to add. If for several readings in a row you're not enjoying yourself, step back, take a deep breath, mix it up (spending time with others in the course is a good way to break up the solitaire monotony), try again. I'm so grateful I took this class, because otherwise I never would have gotten to know so many incredible people while having so much fun.

Vocab is fairly simple to complete. Look over your class notes and perhaps parts of readings that you highlighted (not as sure what to do for the films...hm, maybe completing the 'guiding questions' sheets for them helps; I wouldn't know, it's entirely possible to do well without filling out a single one of those sheets, because that's how good M.

This at times discouraged students from doing the readings as we didn't expect to have a serious opportunity to discuss them. \n\nProfessor Laing's attempt to introduce the readings was welcomed for its intention.

The course also presents different views on the post-9/11 period and contemporary politics, which may be well worth considering in terms of one's personal understanding of the world today. The readings are considerable and possibly in excess of the estimate offered on the syllabus, but generally are very engaging and informative.\n\nI think it's a course with something to offer anyone who spends time thinking about politics and culture today, though likely weighed more towards the former.", "This is a good course if you like history or America.

Also, try to get into a section that's hard to get into, purely because the people who care more about writing (vs. an easy PDF) will be in those sections, so you'll learn more from your peers.

So, I recommend (re-)taking this as a junior or senior. The division between freshmen and non-freshmen in this class was very striking. - This class might take over your life. At least for me, when I knew there was an assignment due, 80% of my brain would be devoted to consciously or unconsciously figuring out what I wanted to write. Don't take concurrently with thesis. - Please watch out for cliches and niches. A lot of the class just wrote about families and deaths in the family because it was what they had had the most emotional experiences with, but it's hard to do well (especially when everyone else is writing about the same thing).

If you aren't particularly interested in war and conflict, you might want to consider enrolling in a course more specific to your interests because everything else tends to be rather undercovered (e.g. trade, development, human rights, etc.). Don't feel overwhelmed by the readings because some of them are very statistical and just generally difficult to understand. When you encounter a reading like this, skim through it and read the conclusions just to get a sense of what it was about. As far as the lectures and textbook readings go, definitely stay committed to reading the textbook because it is more detailed than the lectures.

I would highly recommend taking the class, my only issue with it was the preceptor and there's not much to do about that.  Also, make sure you put in enough work into the written assignments, there's two papers during the semester and are you only two grades besides the midterm, final, and participation.

That said, most of the lectures were interesting, and some of the readings were very interesting as well.  If you want to PDF this class, it is extremely easy.

It's fun and applicable to real life.  The final project involved carrying out your own experiment and was a lot simpler than having to do it in groups.

This year the structure had a few issues, but I imagine those will get worked out, as this was her first year teaching the course.", "This is an engaging course on various phenomena you might be unaware of in our daily lives.

That being said lectures are very good and engaging.", "This was a decent course. I would take it again.", "This was a fascinating course- must take. Touches on all the important aspects of social psychology- and had me questioning my behaviour daily, what external influences were at play that i'd never considered. It really blew my mind.

But it is still very interesting. A lot of people PDF because the writing assignments can be difficult, but if you put enough work in and memorize dates for the exams, you should be fine!", "Lectures were all over the place.

The variety and quality of the professors is great, visiting the art museum for precept every week was awesome, and the tests were fair. I had previous art history experience but if I hadn't I would have found this class a little frustrating because it goes through the history of art too quickly and doesn't do it justice and you kind of just end up with whiplash, but I guess that's expected with only 5 months of it.

If you have a good AP background, you may be fine, but if you don't, wow, you're in for a brutal semester.\n\nThe homework is conducted online through a truly awful automated site on which you will waste many hours of your life trying to figure out why your answer is wrong, only to discover you were giving the vector quantity and not the magnitude.\n\nThe weekly quizzes will ruin your life because the homework is too easy to help you and the learning guides too hard to help (not to mention they only give solutions for some problems). I have no advice to give on these other than be prepared to suffer. \n\nIf you have Galbiati, sorry, he begins so late and ends so early (not to mention canceling lectures entirely) that you will probably end up being in class for less than 50% of scheduled class time by the end of the semester (this year he taught for 48.2% of scheduled class time). During that 48.2% of time, you will endure hopelessly surface-level lectures that will basically throw formulas at you and you'll have to read the textbook a million times, hoping to glean some meaning out of the physics journey that Galbiati has woefully abandoned you on, leaving you wandering alone through the harsh desert of 103 with no provisions to keep you alive but your textbook and the internet. \n\nYou will also have the wonderful experience of using iClickers in class, and no, not for participation points, for actual correctness points. Yes, Professor Galbiati will ask you questions on material you have not yet learned and give you 20 seconds to respond on some unreliable clicker, then grade you on it. You can try reading the textbook to help you, but it honestly probably won't help because it's on very niche level examples, meaning most of the questions end up being bizarre exceptions to the rules you've been learning that class. \n\nIn addition to being very surface-level, the lectures were often barely even related to what we were learning. For example, one week we were given a quiz including the Doppler Effect. However, Galbiati did not teach this concept to us until the next week's lecture. Additionally, we were quizzed on 'power' one week when Galbiati NEVER taught us this concept (thought I missed something, asked some friends, no one was taught it). However, when confronted, Galbiati INSISTED it was taught. Perhaps it would have been included in one of the 3 lectures he cancelled or otherwise in the 51.8% of class time he failed to actually teach for; I would be far more understanding of these shortcomings if he actually were pressed for time, but if you teach for less than 50% of the class, you have absolutely no excuse.  \n\nIf you want to go to office hours, pray you have a preceptor because Galbiati was only sometimes there for his and would not give any notice when he was missing. Unfortunately, your preceptor will likely be pretty bad and precept will end up being a complete waste of your time three times a week, but you'll still feel strangely obliged to go for fear of missing something. Besides, you'll feel like you have no excuse for struggling if you start missing class. \n\nAlas, most of you reading this probably have to take this course; sorry. Be prepared to bunker down and pray to the heavens that you don't have Galbiati because what I witnessed was the poorest excuse for teaching I have seen in my life.
