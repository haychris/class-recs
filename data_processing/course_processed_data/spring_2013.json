It's much more work, and it may take up the majority of your workload, but it's so worth it.", "Take this course if you're interested in COS. You cannot piggy-back off a friend because you will do extremely bad in the final and now you can only work with the same person 3 times. It's also npdf.

The exams can be pretty tough, but if you're worried about the grade, just P/D/F the class and you'll be fine.", "This class demands a lot of attention, but it's worth it. Some aspects of execution are a little mechanical, but the broader picture/algorithms you learn are really interesting.", "This class is much harder with Josh Hug and Arvind Narayanan than it was in previous years", "This class is not too bad, just do your work and study for the tests by doing practices and you should be fine.", "This class is very difficult and the grading is set to high standards. The average for most projects throughout the semester is a 38 or 37/40.", "This course is a great survey of important algorithms in computer science that helps develop practical programming skills. If you're interested in computer science from 126, definitely take it; it's the closest thing to a continuation there is.", "This course is incredible and most definitely should be taken.", "This course teaches interesting and practical material and teaches it well.  Be prepared for some frustration in the highly theoretical exams and weekly exercises.  However, coding assignments are both cool and instructive.", "This is a departmental for me, but I thought it was well-taught (both Arvind and Josh are great!!) and organized.  The programs are much less time-consuming than COS 217's, and the whole course is on Coursera so you can learn at your own pace/make up for missed lectures.", "This is a hard class and you're going to spend a lot of time on it if you want to do well on the programs. That being said, it's a very interesting class and I definitely recommend it if you're at all interested in Computer Science. The algorithms and data structures you learn are very applicable to the real world and this course is very well taught.", "This is a lot more interesting that COS126 and definitely worth taking!", "This is a solid course - it's pretty interesting and generally well-taught. A lot of underclassmen will take this class without many other difficult classes in their schedule, so if you're going to take it and try to get a high grade be prepared to be a bit of a perfectionist. Everything else about the class - the assignments, the teachers, etc. - were solidly good.", "This is a solid introduction to algorithms.  There are a lot of assignments for the class, but none of them are incredibly hard. You'll cover a lot of interesting material, and it will be fun!", "Try going for solo programming, it's more fun", "Will take work and effort, but if you're interested in computer science, definitely worth it to take it!

Bubeck is a good lecturer with a bit of a sense of humor. The slides available on blackboard are good enough that you wont really need to read the book, go to precept, (or as an extreme, go to lecture) every week. And there isn't much content over the course of a semester when compared with a math or cos class for instance. The psets are easy but annoying because there is no collaboration and not always well written. Everyone does well on tests since they aren't that hard. If you're interested, probably worth taking.", "A solid introduction to the basics of statistics. If you take this class with Bubeck be prepared for a tricky derivation on the final. Rigolet's finals are much more straightforward.", "As others have mentioned, it's a \"lose-as-few-points-as-possible\", just like COS 126 and MAT 202.  Don't mess up your calculations and the curve won't hurt you that much.", "Be prepared for the vicious curve. There isn't a lot of R, and if you've taken AP stats, then you've seen all of this material before, but it is definitely difficult to get an A in this course because the average on the tests is often very high.", "Be very thorough in your work.

As for the final, it was very challenging and kind of unexpected.", "Don't take this course. Other courses teach more R and teach statistics better.", "Go for it. The material is not so challenging that you can't wrap your brain around it. Bubeck is pretty good, just a tad boring.", "Good class.", "Good intro stats course, relatively easy material and problem sets to other stats courses or so I've heard.", "Good stats course to take.", "Grade deflation is not your friend in this class.", "I don't know how good the other stats courses are, but the best reason for taking this one is if it's the only one that fits into your schedule. It's fairly redundant if you've taken AP Stat.", "I enjoyed it. I thought the material was interesting and very useful.", "I enjoyed this course as a basic introduction of statistics.  I had never taken stats before, so I don't know how much review it would be from other courses, but I found that the material went slowly enough that I could really absorb it, in contrast to other courses I have taken for my chemical engineering degree.  If you want to learn basic stats, take it, it's a good class.", "I had to learn almost everything by myself with the textbook.", "I learned a lot in this class.", "I think taking it in the fall is better, because the final questions seem to be more regular.", "I took this class with Bubeck and I recommend looking into taking it with Rigollet. I don't know how Rigollet's teaching is, but Bubeck is not a good lecturer. His pace is very slow, he covers the same material multiple times, he proves formulas rigorously (while no one follows along), and is not the best at answering student's questions. In fact, he sometimes even brushes the question off with \"it's obvious that...\" Bubeck's tests seem to always have a proof-based question out of nowhere, which I feel like you can't exactly know how to do by studying stats. Rigollet's exams seem more straightforward stats, even with its challenging questions. Read the textbook and lecture slides and you'll get the concepts you need (beware of Bubeck's lack of skill in making concise lecture slides). Attend precepts as they are helpful in how to approach stats problems.", "I would not recommend taking this class.  I am a physics major who was looking at other potential fields.  This class was basically rote memorization and plugging in to formulas.  If you didn't get near 100% on everything, you would be destroyed by the curve.  I didn't really learn anything useful, and the class wasn't geared to teach anything useful.  If you're an ORF major, I guess you have to suffer.", "I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless needed. It was quite easy to complete the work which is a bonus, but overall it's rather frustrating for an upperclassman who has taken much harder courses.", "If there is one course I would have every Princeton student take, its this one. It's not tremendously complex or entertaining, but will come up again and again everywhere you look.

What is needed from this class can be easily learned on your own.", "If you have already taken AP Statistics and are not required to take this course, don't take it. If you do decide to take the course, you'll be fine as long as you understand the practice problems of each type.", "If you're good at math, take it with Bubeck, and you'll get an A.

However, it is by no means an enjoyable class; just remember to keep things in perspective and to form opinions by yourself.", "Not a BAD course per se (and Lu Xia is an amazing preceptor) but if you want more straightforward exams I'd recommend taking with Rigollet. If you lean more towards proofs and theoretical understanding, then you'll probably enjoy Bubeck's class.", "On the whole, the course is very interesting.  It is definitely challenging, especially with Bubeck, and how he presents the information. His lectures confused me and his exams were really challenging!  One of the midterms was easy, but in that situation, the curve is really rough because many students will get a perfect score. However, the final was very tough and required you to use what we learned and apply it to knew, never seen, situations. It was challenging but many people were disappointed.  I recommend the course because I think it does give a great basis and foundation of statistics compared to other stats courses as Princeton, WWS has much more coding which I feel is irrelevant without a proper foundation.  I would recommend this class and highly recommend focusing on the book above all in order to understand.  If you have precept with Xiaofeng be prepared to go over time and have a session that drags on, and be prepared to be confused by Bubeck.", "Other than the final exam, I thought the class was very fair and not too difficult, and personally thought the material was interesting.", "Precepts are the most important.", "Prepare for a difficult final.", "Standard intro stats course but beware of the unbelievably high curve and scores on the problem sets.", "TAKE IT! It is not difficult if you pay attention in precept and read the book before tests.", "Take it if you have to, and try to make sure your preceptor is Lu Xia.", "Take it if you have to.  Good for MAE math elective.  Don't blow it off even though it's not the most interesting class.  It's easy to do well in if you're actually engaged in the class.  But it's very easy to let it slip by.", "Take it if you need it. Better than any other stats courses... but still a stats course.", "Take it in the fall if possible", "Take it with Bubeck, not with Rigollet and try to have Lu as a preceptor.", "Take this class if you want to get a solid foundation on the basics of statistics! Bubeck teaches spring and it's universally known that he is a harder instructor but I think you'll get more out of the class since he begins to push at more complex problems and expand upon the simple equations and concepts that are required. The curve is also more generous this semester so I've heard.", "Take this course.", "Take this if you're considering more statistics in the future. If not, you will probably get more out of a different statistics course.", "Take this only if you're an ORF major.  Otherwise, you're probably better off taking stats in a different department, as it'll be less work.", "The course can get boring sometimes, though it is important, especially for higher level courses.", "The material itself isn't very difficult, but with a lot of people who have already taken statistics in this class, it can be difficult to get a high grade if you're taking it for the first time.", "This course is a must-take for students without background in statistics.", "This course is not going to be the most interesting course you'll ever take.  That being said, statistics are very useful and you will learn all of the important concepts.  Weichen is a GREAT preceptor.  Prof. Bubeck was a pretty decent lecturer.  Programming experiences (like COS 126) doesn't hurt since you will be using R and once you know how to program in one language, new ones come much more easily.", "This is a challenging course if you have not taken AP Statistics before and are not a computer programmer (there is some programming in R involved).

The problem sets and handouts were essentially just coding, and the quizzes were essentially just conceptual statistics. There was almost no overlap. So, the first time that you'd actually done much of the conceptual work was on the quiz -- there was no practice leading up to it. Moreover, the precept and the lecture were completely unrelated. Not once did we ever go over a lecture concept in precept. The precept simply existed to teach us", "Since this class is required for certain majors, you must take it. But it is helpful.

At least I picked up some new skills that I otherwise wouldn't have.", "This course is literally the worst course I have ever taken at Princeton. I have never experienced such a bad professor, bad preceptor, and bad quality of assignments and problem sets. This course does not deserve to be labeled a Princeton course! Ratkovic is by far the worst professor I have had at Princeton, and it's because he is a terrible teacher. I'm sure he is smart and a great statistician, but he literally does not understand how to teach introductory statistics to students with limited quantitative backgrounds. Not only does he ignore questions from students who struggle with simple issues, but he cannot teach concepts through a framework that allows students to understand simple statistics principles. I (and my friends) learned more from reading the book for 10 minutes than in an entire lecture. I am actually sad that I had to waste an entire course slot on this class. Please, please, please, do not take this course. It will be the worst thing to happen to you at Princeton.

Instead, I found the opposite to be the case. The class should not have been difficult. The amount of statistics we covered was very small, the level to which we were expected to apply the concepts on the exams not very difficult, and the coding (with the exception of intuitively understanding loops) more about your knowledge of the appropriate commands than your reasoning.

The topics are certainly worthy of study, though they exist beyond the officially stated goals of the course as many of the phenomena had remarkably little effect on the trajectory of the United States compared to events such as the American Revolution, Jacksonian Democracy, Reconstruction, the Great Depression, and World War II. Despite the majority of the discussed material coming in the post-war years (1950s through the present), almost nothing was said about the Cold War!\n\nIn short, do not take this class unless they revamp it and replace or rein in the professors.", "I think that the biggest problem with this course is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It seemed at times that it was a course about American Counter-Culture, which would be an interesting course. However, the excessive focus on counter-culture hurt the quality of the class because it also attempted to be about America in general.", "I thought the class was a bit disjointed, but I think the professors will work out the kinks over time-- after all, this was the first semester the new course was offered. Lectures varied significantly in quality and overall weren't that useful. Precept discussions were pretty good. I thought Sarah C. was an excellent preceptor; try to get into her class if she is teaching again!", "I took this course in it's very first year and while interesting, it was rough around the edges and not always particularly coherent. That being said, it has a lot of potential to be great. It all depends on how much you want to put into it. If you can commit to going to all of the lectures and reading the majority of the materials, you'll have a great experience. If you're not willing to, don't take this course, because you won't get anything out of the lectures and precepts if you haven't read.", "I would advise the student not to take the course if they wanted to learn a lot.", "I would advise them to participate in precepts in order to get more from the course.", "I would highly recommend it as an interesting introduction to American Studies and to thinking critically about American culture.", "I would not recommend taking this course.", "I would recommend for people taking an EC but not strongly", "I would say talk to your preceptor as much as possible when it comes to writing the essays - they are a major part of the grade, but it is easy to answer the essay prompt incorrectly because the directions are so unclear.", "I would strongly advise them not to take the class as it currently is. Unless a lot of thought is given to how the material can be more clearly presented and how the assignments can be more closely linked to the class information there are serious problems with this class. Not worth the cost of missing out on a different class here.", "I'd recommend this if you need an EC.

No need for lectures but read.", "It's a good fifth class if you're looking to knock out another distribution requirement and you're generally humanities-inclined. Should come, though, with a goofy, bs-y academia warning label attached.

You'll learn about Supreme Court cases and art and literature and ethnic groups and much else.", "Make sure your prepared to sit through and pay attention through an 80 minute lecture/precept.", "Not a lot of work. Get Professor DeLue as a preceptor and this course will be enjoyable.", "Not too bad, but can become tedious throughout the semester. Interesting subject matter and worth an EC.", "Not too hard - this course will be better the second time around.", "Pay very close attention to the lectures", "Pretty interesting, not too much work. Nothing radical, but fascinating. Not hard. Take it! But only if you're doing the AMS certificate.", "Read the readings and maybe ask preceptors for help on papers. I feel like since they are grading it, they will give good advice. This is something I forgot to do.", "Solid class.  Good EC.  It was good the first time around, but I would bet that it will be much better the second time around.", "Some of the readings and assignments were enjoyable, but a lot of the larger organizational logistics and broad concepts of the course need ironing out before I could recommend AMS 101 to anyone", "Take it", "Take it - interesting, and not a super heavy workload.", "Take it if you need an easy EC.  Nothing intellectually stimulating and no need to go to lecture really.", "Take it, especially if you're interested in critically engaging with the idea of the United States and understanding this country better.

I liked some of the assignments and some of the readings. The lectures were the worst part. Otherwise, it wasn't very difficult, and I learned some things.", "The paper topics can be a bit tedious and annoying, but the readings and lectures can make you think about the major themes in American culture in a whole new way.", "The texts were all really good, the lecturers stimulating though a bit harried.

Not necessarily an easy class. paper grading is a bit hard.", "This course encourages you to explore a lot of different types of mediums that say something about the identity of America. We read a fiction novel, autobiography, journal essays, newspaper articles, visited campus archives, visited the art museum, listened to music, looked at art, watched snippets of plays and movies, and visited the 9/11 Memorial site.

If you're good at physics, you'll have no difficulty - it's not really a hard course as long as you can grasp the concepts. But I personally found it challenging.

His lectures are far more engaging (although they cover less material) and conceptually approachable. He brings a joy to the classroom that can be infectious, and students are overall more relaxed and eager to participate with questions and possible solutions to synthesis questions. That being said, the lectures rarely cover all that is in the reading, but the lectures are honed to a fine point in order to impart a conceptual grasp that allows the reading to make sense quickly. Sorensen's class rarely references the Sorrell textbook; he makes hand-written (with impeccable handwriting) sets of notes that cover everything in the course. These are incredibly easy to follow.\n\nA notable difference between the two courses, which also led me to favor Sorensen, is that Sorensen has practice exams only stretching back to 2008/2009. I found it stressful in Semmelhack's class to know that there were fifteen years' worth of practice exams that I \"could\" do to be more prepared (and in some sense were necessary to be \"fully\" prepared) for his exams. With Sorensen's old tests however,  a much more manageable study schedule can be set. That being said, you may find that this doesn't provide enough practice. \n\nSorensen's exams are bit simpler (or a lot simpler) because they are closed book with one front/back page of notes that you can bring. Since you can't consult old tests or the book or class notes, the test questions are designed to confirm fundamental knowledge and emphasize broad concepts rather than test your ability to recognize trick questions - which often seemed to be the case with Semmelhack exams. There are still \"trick questions,\" but there is less a sense of an overabundance of material to draw on. \n\nSemmelhack's class, however, seems more interesting from an informational standpoint. The synthesis emphasis of Sorensen's class leaves things feelin", "I took this course instead of 304B due to the suggestion of an upperclass who said Sorensen was awesome - and he definitely is! However, Reider was not as good and he teaches half of the lecturers so that made this class less appealing.

What you make really isn't that interesting, they take for-freakin'-ever (that's typical C programming though), and the assignments HAVE ERRORS IN THEM!  I cannot believe there were actual errors in the assignment that weren't fixed until someone told the instructors on Piazza.  That removed ALL incentive to try and start the assignments early because you'd hit a snag somewhere and it would be completely not your fault.  The response we got was \"you guys should figure out these problems yourselves.\"  This is why people who took COS 318 were at an advantage, they were used to these kinds of situations.  Our year the assignments were made much easier, but they still took at least 2 all-nighters (it took me 4 straight all-nighters to finish the router assignment, look forward to that one).  The final exam was fully comprehensive, do not only study the 2nd semester.  Outside of absolutely horrible assignments and really hard exams, this was incredibly informative and useful in lecture.

She was adept at integrating different aspects of African American culture into her lectures--- she synthesized our readings for the course and also integrated them with outside stories. She was dynamic and played music in class, films, and discussed folk lore. Because of her, I learned a lot about the history of the African American experience post slavery. I learned so much and left every precept feeling inspired.\n\nProfessor Perry was really helpful: she provided feedback on drafts of our final papers and was very encouraging. She was mindful to not only discuss the content expected in each paper but also the aspects of writing an argument or a clearly outlined paper. I don't know that I've ever had another professor (outside of writing seminar) who spoke in lecture about how to write a good argument and how to write a paper of that length. I really appreciated that.\n\nProfessor Perry's precept was one of the most enlightening precepts I have ever encountered-- the entire class was thoughtful and considerate. Everyone was engaged. Professor Perry creates an environment where you can feel comfortable to talk about difficult issues. She broadened my understanding of African American culture, but more important than that, she inspired us to have thoughtful conversations about issues of equality.

Go to office hours if you have any trouble, or if you just want to practice speaking and listening. Also go to Japanese Table to practice speaking and listening in a more natural setting.\n\nThe small class sizes mean you really get to know the sensei. You also get to interact every day with your fellow classmates; we've all become friends in my class, which isn't always possible in large classes. I took a semester of French here, and although the class was small, we didn't become nearly as close, possibly because the class was largely us responding to the instructor. In Japanese, you'll have conversations with a different classmate every day. The course itself facilitates total interaction between all students and sensei; a community.\n\nStill not convinced? Talk to current students or the sensei themselves. This class has been my favorite here so far, so look into it!", "Japanese is a fascinating language; it's very different from English.  Even more different than Chinese is.  I would highly recommend this as a language course.", "Japanese is the best! The sensei's are amazing!

But really, if you have the slightest interest in taking Japanese, take it just for the senseis, who are all amazing. I don't think I've heard of any other course where the students and professors get so close. This course feels pretty much like the natural extension of 101 and the only real difference is that the textbook changes to Nakama 2. I think this change is actually one of the downsides, as Nakama 2 seems overall not as well proofread or thought through as Nakama 1.

He nearly never looks back to refer to his notes, and his words spill out so articulately it seemed like he were quoting a written work word for word. From his lectures alone you can tell the man is brilliant and knows more about the topic than probably anyone else. He seamlessly tied in readings into his lectures, proving that he prepared extensively for each 50 minute lecture. He stimulated intellectual curiosity and independent thinking by relating history to current events and asking us to find solutions to existing issues.
