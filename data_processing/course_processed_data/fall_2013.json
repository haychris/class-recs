Do not be intimidated by the fact that it's called \"Advanced\" General Chemistry. For most of the semester you keep pace with the 201 kids and the classes only start to diverge around midterms. The labs are all the same and the overall difficulty is about the same. Additionally, the lecturers for 207 are significantly better than those for 201 (I switched from 201 to 207 after the first week of classes).", "Always attend lectures and take notes. Go to office hours if you can (I didn't do so, and I'm sure it would have helped a lot)", "Always read the chapters", "As a freshman, take this only if you don't have a 5 on AP Chemistry, or if you know beyond a doubt that you want to study chemistry or chemical engineering and possibly materials. Otherwise, you should use first semester to explore other fields. This is a good course to use to fill an STL requirement, however.", "Bocarsly was really helpful- I met with him every week privately to help me not fail the class.  take advanced chem if you are great at chem or if you have to, otherwise I wish I took regular", "By itself, the class does not have an overwhelming workload nor overwhelming material.  I think it was a bit difficult to take with a second lab (PHY 103), but I certainly enjoyed the class. The teachers have enjoyable lectures, the preceptors are incredibly helpful, and if anyone says anything about a review session, go to it!!", "Definitely take it! Lectures are great", "Develop a battle rhythm of reading ahead in order to avoid falling behind in the material.", "Do the homework well and study plenty for the exams.", "Do the problem sets and make sure you know how to do all of them correctly. Go to precept. Lectures are less necessary for success in the class.", "Do your problem sets before precept if at all possible, and make sure to read the applicable chapters before lecture. It is easy to fall behind if you realize the questions you have after the topic has already been covered.", "Don't fall behind in material/readings and go to all the lectures and precepts.", "Fantastic course!  If you have any interest at all in chemistry you should take it, even if you're not BSE (a bunch of my friends and I weren't but still enjoyed the course).  Cava and Bocarsly do a really great job with lectures, and L'Esperance is really helpful in lab too.", "From what I've heard, I would recommend 207 over 202. The course is pretty organized and lectures are generally pretty good. Pretty cool demonstrations in class. Some material on problem sets not covered in class though, so it'd be a good idea to read the textbook. Overall, not that hard of a class. I had to take it because I didn't take AP chem, so I would say it's about equivalent.", "Get Liz - she's fantastic.", "Get help when you need help. Ask questions.", "Go to lecture, its very informative and the demos are awesome.", "Having AP chem would have been a big help (which I did not) but just set aside a lot of time to read the textbook, because without that it will be hard to understand what is going on in class. Don't rely on lectures to teach you how to do the problems and get a tutor early if you feel you need one.", "I think this course is definitely better than taking CHM 201, as the lecturers are way more interesting (Cava) and we have lots of cool demonstrations in class. In comparison, CHM 201 is very drab. However, I still found the course a little boring and would take it only if you have to take a chem course or are very interested in the subject.", "I would recommend making sure that you understand each concept thoroughly before moving on.", "I would recommend taking this course. It was interesting and the professors were both very good.", "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the sciences. It is very intriguing and so practical. I think most students should consider this course.", "I would say that students should make sure they go to precept and study/review sessions to make sure they et the answers to problem sets.", "I would tell another student to focus, and that it is a very interesting topic.", "If you aren't interested in chemistry and this isn't a required class for you don't take it", "If you have to take chemistry 202 in the spring, I would recommend taking chemistry 201 instead (this chemistry class does not go over gases very much)", "If you have to take chemistry, definitely take this class over CHM 201. Especially if Prof. Cava is teaching it!", "If you need CHM as a requirement, definitely take this course. The professor are super funny and helpful and they will try their best to avoid giving boring lectures.", "If you struggle in the beginning, get a tutor asap.", "It is a relatively interesting course, in which you can do well without undue strain, if you keep up with the material throughout the year.", "It is interesting and a good introduction to chemistry. Labs are very easy.", "It's a fun course to take", "It's very important to leave time to do the homework. If you can complete the homework and understand what you're doing and why, tests will be much easier. As with any class, you really can't miss a lecture and expect to still understand all of the content as well on your own. I originally planned to take 201 instead of 207, but chose this class for scheduling reasons. I'd highly recommend that anyone on the fence between those two classes should pick this one; my friends in 201 seemed a lot less interested in the material. Lectures are filled with demonstrations, explosions and quirkiness (provided by Cava especially); lectures hardly ever slowed down or became dull. Also, Liz was an amazing preceptor.", "Its a good course and engineers should take it to get their chemistry requirement taken care of. The information is presented well and if you do most of the readings you should be fine.", "Just take it if you're interested in chem or need to satisfy a course requirement. Although it's an \"advanced\" course, it's not overly rigorous like PHY105 or MAT204 are in comparison to their standard counterparts. In my opinion, in the end it's really just a fairly standard college course that explores a couple of interesting topics.", "Keep on top of problems, do lots of examples from the text book", "Know what you are getting yourself into. If you are an engineering student, someone who has prior experience with general Chemistry or is prepared to challenge themselves, this course is for you. However, if you are unsure in your Chemistry abilities, or are just taking this course to try and finish pre-reqs faster, you're gonna have a bad time.", "Lectures are helpful for getting information not in the book, but don't really help for learning what is actually in the book.", "Make sure that you stay ahead with content. The professors will approach each lecture as if you already understand the major concepts in a given secti", "Make sure to go to precepts and try to get Justin Cook for a lab TA!", "Make sure you attend all precepts and do the homework in a consistent fashion.", "Make sure you do all the readings and not leave problem sets for the last minute", "Make sure you read that chem book! It's a life saver! And go too ALL the lectures and precepts!", "Make sure you understand every single problem in each weekly problem set.", "Medium workload.", "Most people in this class are engineers who have had general chemistry before. I would suggest you read the book before lecture and start the problem sets early, so you can go to office hours if you have questions. This class is really what you make it. You can try to just get by, but you won't learn much.", "My advice for students is to go to every precept because that is where most of the learning is and sit in the front of the lecture as much as possible.", "Only take this course if you think the sciences are a possibility for a major.  It is a good class for the material it covers.", "Pay attention in lecture, and don't just take notes on what is written on the board, also take notes on what the professor says.  Also find a way to organize your lecture notes because if you copy it all down the way it is written on the board, the notes will be a little confusing later.  Also practice good lab procedure so the last lab is a piece of cake.", "Pay attention in lecture, ask questions in precept, do the homework and take good notes in lab. Basically be a good student and keep up and it'll go well.", "Read ahead!", "Read before beginning of week's lecture", "Read the textbook to see specific examples and go to precept with questions from the problem set.", "Read the textbook. Odds are if you're having trouble understanding something discussed in lecture, the textbook will clear things up.", "Slightly regret taking it - wish I had taken 201 instead.", "Stay on top of stuff, the class builds.", "Stay on top of the concepts on a week-by-week basis, because there is a lot of it, and make a personal connection with either a professor or graduate student, because then you will be able to personally be involved in the class and will definitely get a lot more out of it.", "Stay on top of the material from the beginning and do weekly reviews, the information piles up.", "Study the material and you should be fine.", "Take - especially if you're an engineer! Fun demos and not terribly challenging.", "Take it - despite being 'Advanced', it's roughly the same difficulty level as 201. Plus, because it's one semester (and thus geared more towards the BSE chem requirement), the curve isn't as bad as in 201 with the pre-meds. You cover less out of the book than 201 does, too, and the materials units that they replace it with are not difficult. Cava's stunts and hijinks help make it interesting.", "Take it if you are looking for a nice STL with some good problem solving.", "Take it if you don't mind a higher work load and a ton of meticulous labs.  Precepts kind of stink, but the lectures are fun for most of the semester.", "Take it over CHM 201, but only for requirement purposes.", "Take it. It is a better chemistry course than 201. Read the book; it is very helpful.", "Take this class if you need a gen chem requirement", "Take this class only if you need to. If you're an AB student like me, take CHM 202 instead. Due to scheduling issues, I had to take CHM 207, but I would have preferred taking CHM 202 because it was difficult for me to take such a quantitatively focused class.", "Take this course over 201 because the challenge is worth it and it's a great class.", "Take this course over CHM 201. The professors are great, the work is manageable and not too difficult if you don't leave it to the last minute and you really can learn a lot if you put in the effort. (If Liz is a preceptor, try to get her!)", "The course gets really hard very quickly.", "The lectures are helpful for conceptual material, but they alone aren't enough to prepare you for the problem sets and exams. Make sure you learn how to do the calculations/use the formulas from the textbook.", "This Chemistry course is amazing! I highly recommend that you take it. It will help you appreciate Chemistry!", "This class is definitely more interesting than CHM 201 and the lectures are very interesting with cool demos. The material is generally pretty easy to follow and explained well. The textbook is helpful for problem sets and exams.", "This course follows the textbook really well, but I would also recommend to attend every lecture and precept because both are extremely helpful in preparing for the exam.", "This course seemed much more interesting than CHM 201. Our professors were entertaining and helpful.", "This course was great.  I would recommend that anyone even remotely interested in Chemistry should take it, especially when Professor Cava is teaching!", "This is an excellent option for those who need only one semester of chemistry", "This was a very well structured course. Read the textbook and attend the lectures. Very interesting material and great lectures for an introductory science course.", "Unless you want to be a Chem major, take Chem 207 over 201. From what I've heard, 207 is more interesting and more fun. 207's demos are awesome and it gives you a great foundation for general chemistry.", "When you can, do the problem sets when they're assigned, not the weekend before they're due. You write down a lot of things that seem important at the time, but end up being less important later. At the end of each chapter, rewrite down the most important parts ONLY on another sheet of paper. This sheet of paper will grow over time and it will be a great study guide for the exams. Do the labs well on the first draft and ask your lab TAs a lot of questions.", "You have to take it for engineering.

Much more enjoyable course if you are interested in the material.", "In the end, I would suggest not taking this course if Professor Graziano is teaching it. It's not that he's a bad lecturer, it's that the final exam was unfair--not in the sense that the questions were hard, but in that the questions used very specific terms that were most certainly not used in class. After the final, I looked through my notes everywhere for some of the terms that had been used on the exam itself and could not find them anywhere. Only after googling them did I find they came from his own papers, and I can assure you, the topics were not mentioned in class using that specific terminology. I did very well on the first two exams, but expect a low grade on the final simply because I did not know what the questions were asking or what the answer choices (multiple choice) were saying.", "Interesting course shouild you have any interest", "It is necessary to learn the basics of neuroscience - which is a lot of memorization.

If the grading system changes, definitely take it.", "The most important thing is to pay close attention to the lectures and clarify any unclear information in precept. The textbook is a good resource for most of the course if you miss something in lecture or want more information.", "The only way to do well is to take ferocious notes during lecture and study study study for the tests.", "This class is for those very interested in neuroscience. Also, most people struggle with staying awake in this class because Graziano's voice is very monotonous.

It is understandable why we only got a surface-level look at these issues: this is a sampler course that examines SO MANY essential life issues and current political issues that it's hard to go into detail.  \n\nPeter Singer is amazing. The guest lecturers (we have them almost every week!) are prominent in their fields and well-spoken as well as well-informed. Powerpoint slides are clear and pretty-looking. The reading for this course was selected very carefully and very well, although the quantity of readings got overwhelming at times (aka every time).\n\nDon't get precept with Peter Kurie. He's a nice guy (really nice), but doesn't really know how to foster discussion, and definitely didn't focus the precept on PHILOSOPHY (maybe because he's an Anthro student?).

Word of caution is that there are some papers involved, so if you don't like writing, then this might not be for you. But the readings and lectures equip you for those papers.

This class very much met those expectations. I was mostly engaged, except in precept where I felt vaguely like there were too many different levels of understanding/misunderstanding in the room.\nThe TAs and COS department support in general are STELLAR. There is no reason that anyone should go through this class and not understand how to complete each assignment. Donna Gabai is a goddess among men. And the assignments themselves are really satisfying (though difficult) and instructive.", "I took this course for general interest and it ended up being a much bigger/more stressful time commitment than I anticipated. If you don't have prior coding experience, expect to spend a lot of time feeling lost and figuring things out on your own.

It's an excellent introduction to computer science, it's well-organized, and the programming assignments are a lot of fun.", "I would highly recommend that another student take this course, firstly. I would also suggest that they keep up with the readings so as to keep up in lecture and precept, and to not leave assignments till the last minute; when done carefully and with great thought, they are a great learning tool.", "I would highly recommend this course to students, and I would advise them to attend precepts every week.", "I would recommend completing the problem sets in a timely fashion and studying a lot for the examinations.", "I would recommend it to everyone. It is a great way to satisfy a QR requirement while also learning a useful skill. If you are worried about it being difficult, office ours and TA lab session are great and provide a lot of support.", "I would recommend that all students taking this course look to go to the Friend Center as soon as they find that there is a bug that they don't understand. The first time that I went was to get help with a bug that I never would have understood on my own, and it makes me wish that I had asked for assistance with some of my earlier assignments.", "I would recommend that other students pay attention in lecture and precept and work hard to learn everything because the material is difficult.", "I would say that this is a straightforward class that covers a breadth of introductory material very well.", "I would tell them to take advantage of the TA hours when they need help. I would tell them to also start assignments early.", "If you are interested in computer science, take this class. It is challenging and time consuming, but very rewarding. The difficult part for me was keeping up with the material. Specifically, it's important to keep up with the material that is needed for the programming assignments AND the material that is not really used in programming but is tested on- and the tests are worth a good amount.", "If you are looking to gain a basic understanding of programming and functional thought processes, then this is the right class to take.", "If you are self-motivated, I'd suggest you try learning the basics of COS on your own, rather than taking this course. That said, I did learn a good amount, and the assignments were fun.", "If you don't have a lot of programming experience, you will have to invest a lot of time in this class. If you have some programming experience, the assignments are really engaging without being too difficult.

You'll be exposed to so many topics that you're bound to find something engaging.", "If you're going in knowing a bit of coding, don't skimp out on the classes. There's a lot of circuits and other materials covered that wouldn't be expected from the class.", "If you're not a COS major, or not analytically-minded, you might struggle some, but honestly, I think that as long as you put the time in, you will be fine. I'd highly encourage you to take this course. Learning about the ways in which computers and programming intersect the real world is fascinating, and the assignments are really interesting because they have so many real world applications. I spent about 5-10 hours on average a week on this course. Also, if you're stuck on an assignment, I highly recommend going to the lab TA's. I wouldn't suggest waiting until Monday though cause then you'll have to wait in line for half an hour to an hour sometimes, depending on how many people are also trying to finish last minute. Piazza is really helpful too, and instructors do a good job of checking the forum frequently and answering questions quickly. Also, Donna Gabai is very, very helpful.

It takes a lot of time to become familiar with not just the language of programming but all of the new and nuanced ideas that are packed alongside it. Every week is a struggle to understand new material enough so that you can complete a problem set, and that is further compounded by very abstruse programming exams. I would say take the course only unless your VERY interested, have experience, or have a lot of time.

Josh is a good programmer and knows his stuff, but his creativity doesn't translate that well into lecturing. He can be a bit disorganized and have a hard time explaining things sometimes just because he has so many ideas flowing at once. People stopped going to his lectures because they are all posted on Coursera by Kevin Wayne, so as long as you watch the lecture later or just go through the lecture slides, you should be fine. (Kevin Wayne is a good lecturer though, very straightforward.) Josh taught for the first time last semester and his exams were overly difficult because he felt they were not creative enough.

Thus, students who have taken orgo before, or have had a decent exposure to molecular orbital theory (i.e. those who took Princeton CHM 201/202), are already closer to mounting the learning curve once they enter the course. For those who only had basic college level general chemistry, much like the AP in high school, there is some work that needs to be done.\n\nToo often I found myself and my other freshmen friends in orgo not grasping the concepts ON TIME. We would slowly reach an understanding of the material as the midterms approached, at which point we would let the practice exams teach us. We weren't even close to achieving the ideal: \"mastery.\" We hardly learned from lectures and we never did textbook reading during the weeks leading up to exam week. That is the number one thing I would change and I would ask others to anticipate. You have to READ the textbook, and yes, it will be a little hard. Don't listen to all the people who tell you the textbook is awful. They probably spent 30 minutes one evening trying to read it and then stopped. If you slowly digest the textbook's material, you won't LEARN everything, but you'll form a foundation. You'll actually be able to UNDERSTAND what Semmelhack will say in lecture the next day, or what he said this morning. You will go into your precept ready to learn how to put those concepts into practice, and ready to ask your preceptor questions - instead of walking in and spending 20 minutes trying to get your preceptor to explain the basic concepts that he/she assumes you have begun to study.

Lectures can be a bit dry at times and precept is average.", "The best way to study is to think of the major themes (i.e. the relationship of religion and medicine) of the class and come up with 3-5 examples (in different time eras) that fit with these themes. In order to do that, you'll have to pull evidence from lectures/notes/precept but it is really the ONLY way to be prepared. I also think recording lecture is a good way to go (it's not necessary to listen to these in order to do well, but it's useful in case you didn't write everything down -- the lecture slides themselves are NOT useful outside of lecture).", "The final project is not easy but is pretty fun - do a podcast!  You must attend lectures - they are the heart of the class.", "The material is definitely interesting, but the presentation is often uninteresting.", "The material is interesting, but the class is boring.

Lectures are interesting and are fairly common sense, but with interesting twists and insights that Professor Guenther injects into them.", "The subject is interesting, and the lectures get the job done. If you're independently interested in the topic, you'll probably enjoy it, but don't expect the course to convert you if you aren't.", "There are a lot of readings and the lectures were difficult to follow.", "There are pre-meds everywhere which could be intimidating at first, but you'd be surprise how little history they actually know about medicine. This class is approachable for anyone regardless of medical knowledge. Everything you need to know you'll learn in class and precept. However, the readings really are great, so I really recommend doing your reading.", "There is a lot of reading, but it's not a problem at all if you plan ahead and keep up on it. This course involves 5 reading responses (at least it did in the fall of 2013) that are 300-700 words each - but you can pick when you want to write them over the course of the semester, which is really nice!", "This class is well-taught, and the exams are very fair. The reading is often lengthy, so make use of skimming for the most important points.", "This course is a lot of fun. The lectures are incredibly interesting, and the precepts were usually fun. It's a bit of work--150ish pages of reading and 5 short response papers, but it's totally doable.", "This course is a ton of work for a distribution requirement.  Keeping up with the readings, lectures, and other students can be challenging if you don't have the time or dedication. Lots of premeds, and no pdf... enough said.", "This is a great HA for those who don't usually like history classes. It opened my eyes to how history is not just memorizing facts and spitting it back out (like in high school). Those who enjoy sciences or medical topics will especially like how this course connects science and medicine to economics, society, politics etc and shows how medicine has been influenced by so many aspects of the world besides scientific discoveries. It may be a bit difficult in the beginning to catch on to the way of thinking of connecting in this class, but go to office hours, ask questions! Try to choose a precept that is later in the week so that you can listen to lectures with the general themes before reading the more detailed accounts in pequod for discussion.", "This is a great course, covers lots of info you should probably just know before graduating. Readings are interesting and not too long.", "This is a great survey course which covers a huge expanse of time in shallow detail. It's a great class to take for a low-stress and interesting HA, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're thinking about the history of science concentration; it'll help you narrow down what time period your interests lie in. Try to pick your preceptor carefully, because my overwhelmingly positive experience had a lot to do with the fact that my preceptor was awesome.", "This is a history course at Princeton; the purpose is not to learn cool facts about medicine in the past, but to analyze events carefully and correctly within historical context. Remember this from the beginning. The course pack is very expensive also (over $90) - keep that in mind. Grading is difficult and subjective. I was surprised at how much we could be wrong precept and in papers - not like English classes (high school anyway), where different interpretations are welcome as long as they are justified.", "Try and get a good preceptor because they grade every single one of your assignments and in doing so determine your grade for the course.", "Yes, although get ready to read a lot.", "You should absolutely take this course.

My one bit of advice is to start your projects early - although I'm pretty sure midterm week and reading week are going to be a bit rough regardless in finishing them, but working in teams were other people can be fun.  I personally enjoyed my team on the first project - the crane project - more than the second, which affects one's motivations a bit, but you can make it interesting regardless of who you're working with.

He is not so good that you will be captivated regardless of how youre feeling. If you normally fade throughout lecture and get drowsy, that will happen. However, he does not allow any electronics in class (you will have to take hand written notes) so you won't get distracted from the internet. The normal lecture is about 40 min with 10 min of video and audio and these breaks are nice but you'll fall asleep if you're tired since he turns off the lights for them. In both lecture and precept, you'll frantically take notes and this information may or may not be found in that weeks readings (it's hit or miss). The readings in general are very manageable and interesting if you are interested in US history. They are not like ethics readings etc where they take forever to get through. There is not much work since the readings are the only hw. The midterm and final are both made up of ID's and essays. The real essay prompts are given in advance though you don't know which specific one will be given for the midterm and final.

How is it different from languages I use now?  Why does Jane Street only use OCaml?  It can't be that different, right?  WRONG!  Functional languages, unless you're a math major (let me address this later), are incredibly unintuitive.  Imperative languages work the way our brains think, in lists.  \"First, crack two eggs, then beat the eggs, then add flour to the mixture, etc...\"  This way of thinking is how lists or for loops work.  Functional languages instead try to fit all 25 steps into one recursive call.  \"Take the mixture of eggs that you cracked and beat and added flour to and kneaded the dough before sugar was mixed with milk...\"  Oh yeah, did I mention recursion?  EVERYTHING in OCaml uses recursion, so get used to it.  The compiler for OCaml is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen.  There are no online sources to help you because NO ONE USES OCAML!  Don't know why your program isn't working in Java?  Search StackOverflow, there's plenty of people there who ran into the same problem.  Have the same one with OCaml?  Sucks for you.  You will be eternally frustrated when it takes you 40 minutes to add two arrays of numbers recursively.  Oh yeah, did I mention recursion?  My math major friends who took this class absolutely love OCaml.  \"It's so simple!  The programs are so short, there's no boilerplating!\"  That may be true, but I don't want to spend 100x the time I should on a simple problem because OCaml is impossible to write at any reasonable speed.  It was enlightening to learn about functional programming languages, and Walker is great at teaching (Just ignore his \"OCaml 1, Java 0\" jokes every 15 minutes).  **TL;DR** OCaml sucks.  If you'd like to submit yourself to try and learn this, it is interesting enough.  **VERDICT** Neutral.  Oh yeah, did I mention recursion?", "TAKE THIS COURSE!

The exams aren't easy, the problem sets take significant amount of time, but I think it's worth it", "This course does a very good job teaching the fundamentals of a strong alternative programming paradigm that enforces great programming practices. If you are looking to be a better programmer, have any interest in functional programming, would like to learn another language, or are just looking for another class for fun, this is an excellent choice.

Lecture is a chore to go to, Malik is not good at holding an audience, and the material progresses SO slowly.

Imagine a java'ed C, where the compiler doesn't tell you certain errors, it's impossible to debug, and you have to be in the equad in order to code.

And the worst part was the PUnC, a Dean's Date assignment, isn't even worth 10% of your grade and you have to spend 30+ hours fixing it (in the Equad) with TAs who don't really understand Verilog or ModelSim well either.

I took it to see if I was \"good enough\" at math to do it, and I was, but it wasn't necessarily enjoyable. It oscillates between problems with interesting geometry and theoretical problems. If you know you don't like theory, I would strongly advise against it. The geometry problems won't make up for how much theory there is. If you're trying to figure out if you like theory, take it and you will definitely find out. I'm glad I took it, but it takes a lot of work and staring at confusing notation to get through some of the harder problem sets.", "This class is very challenging, and a good taste of the rigors of college mathematics.

Take this class if you are looking for a challenge/have studied multivariable calculus before.", "This course is slightly harder than 201 but both are difficult and this one explains some of the topics better than 201.  The most important thing to do for this class is to find a group of people to do the problem sets with and to study for the exams with.  Other people in the class understand different part of the material that you may not and together you all do a lot better than you will do individually.  Scheduling group pset time may be hard but it is definitely worth it.", "This course is very difficult and takes a lot of time.  Unless you like math or have more experience than just Calc BC, I would recommend taking 201 instead.", "This is a course that covers a very basic material in mathematics. If you have any interest at all in math, you should take it.", "This is a very difficult course, but is rewarding.

Expect to spend 5 to 8 hours on problem sets and find good people to collaborate with.", "You will understand the material presented to you extremely well, especially because the professors and the textbook are very clear. However, that does not necessarily mean the tests and problem sets will be easy, so do not be discouraged.", "You're probably considering 203 vs. 201 right now, unless you're a physics major. Know that 201, according to those I know, is significantly easier, but also not at all engaging. I enjoyed many things about 203, but it can be fairly frustrating at times. I'd recommend it with caution. Make sure you do a lot of extra problems and don't get discouraged if you perform poorly; there's a generous curve and we had at least one test that just came out of left field. It's not your fault, but you -can- do better if you prepare. Find a group of friends to work together with, and your life will be a lot better and your understanding stronger.

Keep up with the readings, ask questions in lecture and in precept.", "Take this course!

But I think you'd miss out that way.  Sit in the front of the lecture. It's a lot more engaging that way. Nunokawa rambles sometimes but he is such a genuine professor and I am touched each week by how much he wants to teach.  He also has very thoughtful analyses of the novels we read.  Try to get a good preceptor.  It really makes all the difference, as my preceptor was dull and I felt like I missed out on more thoughtful/profound discussions.", "You will never, ever regret this course.

If you've taken MAT 201 / MAT 202 and hate doing all the computation but love reading the book and learning all the theory, take this class. It worked out amazingly for me. 2. Ana is a great professor. Very approachable and smart. Go to office hours -- the book misses many insights that she'll show you. 3. The end of the course brings together insights from continued fractions, Pell's equation, quadratic reciprocity, quadratic fields, and primes in a beautiful way. You'll find out what that means. 4. There is a ton of support -- two office hours, three TA hours. Don't be scared if you've always wanted to learn how to do real math. 5. Lectures are hard to absorb. Read the book. The entire thing. That's the only way to understand the beauty (and do well on the tests).", "The class is fun, but be prepared to spend a lot of time working on problem sets!!", "This is a difficult course that demands a lot of time--not only for the problem sets but also simply to read and re-read the proofs in the text.

The class is really a number of different courses all rolled into one: Crime, Environmental Econ, Financial Regulation, Healthcare, Education, Inequality, etc. Great for anyone who doesn't have time to take all of the aforementioned classes. Fair warning: there is a boatload of work: midterm, final, a policy proposal, 10 P-sets, and weekly prep for precept. Precepts are awful, not because of David or Professor Bogan, but because none of the Woody Woo majors/Econ people actually gave a damn about the subject matter. All they want to do is shout out the answer to the question asked in precept so they can get a better participation grade. Beware of them, but don't allow them to deter you from taking the class! This course uses a fair bit of single variable calculus, but I found it quite manageable; just review the chain rule before taking the class!

The knowledge you'll get on these topics is indispensable for anyone that wants to be an informed citizen.", "This is a fantastic course, and I think that every undergrad at Princeton should take it.

At the beginning of the semester, I was somewhat annoyed and even discouraged at how nothing seems definite, that there is no one answer to any question.

Professor Biehl is fantastic at drawing out themes and universal lessons from specific examples.  Don't be afraid to speak up in class or precept--the diversity of viewpoints makes this class interesting.  The coolest aspect of this course is how it covers a vast variety of topics: there are many guest lecturers to share their specialties, and the instructors encourage students to further explore the field as it relates to their home discipline.  For any given student, some subjects will undoubtedly be more interesting than others, but they're all important to gain at least a superficial understanding of the key issues in global health today.", "Pretty interesting, but you cover a wide variety of topics so don't be surprised if you find some quite boring and others more exciting.

Professor Barany is a good lecturer, but somewhat difficult to take notes from (a fact which will kill you on the take-home final.) The grading is really tough, so by all means do NOT take this class if you're looking for an easy A departmental. The readings are tedious, although if you take the time to read some you'll learn a lot. Class participation is taken extremely seriously, so don't take this class if you think you can get away with just a few comments throughout the semester.

The material covered was really interesting and I was looking forward to the class, but it was ruined by the fact that the expectations were utterly unrealistic, and grading was absurdly harsh as well as somewhat arbitrary. I'm pretty sure it was largely a result of Michael's insecurity. Unfortunately, this kind of unconstructive harshness only makes me lose respect for an instructor.  If he wanted better-crafted historical arguments, he should either have mentioned that prior history experience would be helpful in the course description, or actually taught us the basics. The way the course was described it was bound to contain many science-oriented people without much exposure to history, and that should have been accounted for. If an entire class performs below expectations on a paper, it's a sign that the expectations need to be adjusted. I've never before taken a class at Princeton where the instructor failed so badly in this respect. Grading between the first two papers was also very inconsistent (in my case. more than a letter grade discrepancy for similar papers with similar comments) and the comments were so sweepingly negative that they weren't helpful. By comparison, I've done fairly well in every other humanities or social science course I've taken at Princeton and never gotten below a B  on a paper before this class, so it's not that I don't know how to write.

Any college student that sets aside four years of their youth to further their education, at any institution, deserves better than a course taught by Michael Barany. Here are reasons that you should not take his class, and perhaps avoid interacting with this man altogether: \n\n1. If you are more than 15 seconds late, he will write down the exact time that you walked in, and deduct that from your participation. Evidently, addition and subtraction are the most sophisticated mathematical operations of which Barany is capable.\n2. Taking random sample of 8 students grades on the second paper of a 16 person in the class, Barany had awarded an F, 4 D's , 2 C's and a B. Each of these papers had a coherent thesis, cited, argumentative evidence, correct formatting, and met the stipulated word limit. This is a clear violation of the Princeton University grading rubric. \n3. When explaining the logic behind his Draconian grading, he simply cited the fact that you overlooked an argument which he had suggested, or a resource which he had insisted that you use. This may not directly violate any tenets of the Grading Rubric, but is nevertheless an affront to all original academia. \n4. I am thoroughly disappointed that Professor Skinner was unable to provide any lectures, as his insights into the history of mathematics would have been much more profound than any of those which Barany could rattle off in his insufferable lectures. \n5.

However, definitely do NOT take this if your only reason is to fulfill the HA requirement. Michael expects an unreasonable amount out of us. Maybe this is because it is his first time teaching or because he is just so passionate about history of math, but he assigned way too much reading and graded way too harshly, even for Princeton standards. Just to make things clear, I am not suggesting that you should avoid this course if he ever teaches it again. Instead, you should make sure you really do like history and you really are willing to put in time to learn the history of mathematics. Then you will get a lot out of the class.

The only thing I would warn is that the content is difficult, especially towards the end, Make sure you are willing to put the time into the class.  If you do, you will definitely get something out of it.", "If you don't do well on the midterm, drop", "It's a nice course, Professor van Handel does a good job of explaining things. You get a rough idea of how stochastic calculus works and gentle semi-proofs of various ideas, plus applications to options pricing. More breadth than depth, obviously as this is more of an applied course. The homeworks are short, but some can be time-consuming because some questions involve nasty derivations. Usually there is   a Matlab coding question for implementing some simulation as well.", "Ramon van Handel is a brilliant and highly engaging professor. He makes a sincere effort to ensure that everybody in the class understands exactly what he is talking about, and is a master at explaining things in a clear and concise fashion. But what I find even more impressive and helpful are his lecture notes on Blackboard, which are comprehensive without being overwhelming. I stopped going to lecture at some point because I realized these notes were all I needed to understand the material, but I slightly regret this since Handel explains the material extremely well. The problem sets did an excellent job of ensuring that we understood that week's work of material without being overwhelming. I was slightly annoyed that many students in the class would collaborate extensively on the problem sets (to the point where they would try to get the answer from other people rather than figuring it out themselves). This especially revealed itself during office hours with Geoffrey, during which many students would basically try to squeeze the homework solutions out of him. As a result, those who cannot attend office hours are put at a significant disadvantage (especially since homework is 40% of the course grade). The final exam for this course tends to be very difficult (the midterm is hard too but much more manageable). I would starting his practice exams EARLY so that you understand their style and so that you can ask Van Handel about how to approach certain problems (he does not post the practice exam solutions on Blackboard).", "TAKE IT. Ramon is an incredible professor and the topic is fascinating.", "Take it if only tobe in van Handel's lecture.

But it is different than 309: less work, except for very occasionally you are forced to just sit down and do brute force calculations and you end up using up an entire eraser before you get it do work. Or maybe thats just me.", "Take it!", "Take it, especially if you're thinking of grad school in any engineering/quantitative field. Stochastic calculus is super cool and pretty important and Ramon is awesome.", "Take this course if you're remotely interested in the subject.

Ramon is an amazing professor and explains things very clearly.", "This course is definitely worth taking if you want a quantitative course.", "This is a great course, the professor is really good and make you want to learn more! The financial applications are a pretty big part of the course though so think twice if that's not what you want to learn!", "This is probably the best class in the ORFE department, but it isn't easy, so be ready (I should have PDF'd because I knew I wouldn't have time to study) The final is especially hard!). At the same time, even if you PDF it is fantastically taught and quite interesting.", "Trade an arm and a leg to get into Prof. van Handel's class. He is the most profoundly clear, well meaning, and comprehensive professor you could hope to get. Even though he's so approachable, he is also a genius and you should not miss any opportunity to be inspired from someone like him.The material is difficult (quadruple of ORF309 brownian motion stuff difficulty) and I personally thought it was meant for a certain type of people somewhat more mathematically inclined than I was but Prof van Handel did everything to make it easier for students like me to grasp. If you think you have come to a world class university to learn something new and be wowed by it, this is the class to take to feel that. You will feel overwhelmed at times by the complexities of the topic but Prof. van Handel's enthusiasm for the topic is infectious and you will soon fall in love with his beautiful notes, his explanations during office hours  on why something magically works and in general everything associated with the class.

Lectures are the biggest waste of time I've ever been subjected to in my life, primarily spent tracing through algorithms on trivial inputs in order to prepare you for tracing through the same algorithms on more obnoxious inputs in the mindnumbing problem sets. This might be helpful, if Mizil knew what he was doing and made tracing them through easier, but no, because then lecture would not be a complete waste of time. Other than tracing through algorithms, he spends the rest of the time following the book word for word. If you don't believe me (and if he's still teaching it next year), read the first reading before the first class. You'll quickly realize that you haven't learned anything new, before you know it you'll be asleep, and class will be over. I guess I should say some positives about this class: some of the programming assignments aren't too bad (SAT-solver, Machine Learning), and the rest you just implement algorithms so they are pretty easy.The staff for this class are so pretentious that they delete comments that disagree with them on Piazza, and also refuse to consider regrades unless they have an impact of 5 points or more.

Therefore, fewer and fewer showed up. Unfortunately, the requirements stayed the same and therefore it was relatively harder to meet them.\n\nAnother negative is that everyone ends up doing the so-called Honors Points (which can be very tedious), so they don't differentiate in the end.

First, if grading mistakes are made, they won't look at it unless it has a net five point effect. I see the reasoning behind this, but if you do something right on HW, you should get credit for it. Imagine if you lost fewer than five points on multiple homework assignments; it could clearly have an effect. People aren't going to bring you every homework asking for points, unless they actually got something correct. But by far the worst part of the course is the \"Honor Point\" system. We were told the first lecture that if one did all the normal parts of HW and got them all correct, the BEST grade that could be gotten was a B . So essentially, these HP are not extra credit at all. They are often way harder and demand twice or three times the amount of work than the rest of the assignment, and are worth fewer points. It's incredibly rough, and rewards those who have lots of time. If you want to assign HW, just do it and make it required for everyone, so if you do all that's required perfectly, you'll get a good grade in the class. The HP system made no sense at all. On top of that, the lectures were terrible. This has been the worst class I've taken at Princeton.

While having a good understanding is helpful, a lot of time the course felt like a game involving how well you absorb and memorize facts. Bogan is an extremely intelligent person but her slides have very little structure to them (they're just facts scattered here and there) and I did not like how instead of carefully explaining fundamental concepts she would IMMEDIATELY put them in the context of current events. Again, most of the positive reviews here are probably from overeager freshmen who have enough time on their hands right now to do all of the readings and memorize the information. I know several upperclassmen who ended up pdf-ing this course (or wish they had). Note: I also was not in her precept.

I worked very hard in this course, went to every lecture, supplementary lecture, and precept, and did every assignment and lab. The professor seemed to feed us just a bunch of facts, and didn't stimulate intellectual curiosity at all. We were given very little guidance on the lab report, the main writing component of this course. Grading seemed really arbitrary, and there was often no justification for why some points were taken off. The midterm was fair, but the average grade for the class was a C, and I have heard from multiple people that the professor said it is not being curved at all, which is absurd. The professor made us all very very scared to submit regrades, even though many of us felt like some points were taken off without justification. 'If you submit a regrade, I will grade them harshly, and maybe take off more points if I feel it's appropriate.' The professor was EXTREMELY unavailable for her 'open' office hours. Scheduling a meeting with her seemed like I was putting a huge burden on her; when I met with her, she seemed extremely disinterested. Some students went to her for her 'open' office hours, and she literally shouted at them for not making an appointment. When students expressed trouble with the material, she would say things like 'I taught this course at a state school; if they can handle it, so can you!' She was also allegedly in a romantic relationship with one of the course's preceptors, which made me feel uncomfortable complaining about any issues with the way he ran his precept. The entire course felt like the professor and the preceptor did not want us to succeed. I am genuinely interested in evolution, but the course felt like a huge numbers game and memorization exercise, and did not stimulate my curiosity AT ALL.

Nevertheless, Angel's discussions are incredibly engaging and the reading assignments touch on every facet of literature all the way from Spanish romances of the 17th century to Borges, to modern films, and photograph. Although I doubt you will develop your Spanish speaking skills, I can assure you that your writing will be better. He's helpful with papers and very flexible with your concerns. In fact, we said we didn't feel like doing the writing assignment for the last week of the class and he let us. I should comment though, you're better off discussing with him first, especially for the two comentario largo, what he would prefer rather than trying to be creative. This wasn't a problem for me, but some people did have serious issues with him in that regard and also occasionally in class discussions when he would tend to ignore people. He loves to listen to himself talk, and I actually enjoyed it when he did. I felt like I was enlightened after every class in analyzing literature yet an idiot at the same time.

Math courses at Princeton are intense - just because you aced AP Calc in high school does not mean you can slack off and do well. It's a whole new level, and you're graded on a curve, so many of the other people you're competing with will also have done AP Calc in high school.

Keep up with material, and learn the TCA cycle (especially the roles and locations of NADH and FADH2) as soon as you learn it in class.  Review sessions with Colleen are helpful.

The course starts with talking about the types of biological macromolecules, and then the other ~2/3 covers different pathways in metabolism.  You'll have to know all the details to things like glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation, but at the end of the course, all the minutiae you worked so hard to learn elegantly comes together to show how our bodies function.

It is exciting to grasp the chemistry behind the processes in cells. The integrative nature is fulfilling, as you build up to understanding how the different pathways in metabolism work as an interconnected system. You will leave this class with a deep comprehension of the molecular events enabling life to occur. Given the connected nature of what you learn, keeping up with the material is crucial. You have a good amount of resources at your disposal, from the class notes, to the textbook, to review sessions, and make sure to use them.

PHI 202 provides a bedrock for understanding ethical debates that you will encounter in other departments like Politics, Religion, and Economics. It also differs from other ethics classes because it has a more useful structure.  It starts off with metaethics (e.g. \"What is an ethical property, and how could such a property be determined? What is the good and what is the bad?\") and then moves onto normative theories like utilitarianism and deontology and finally to applied ethics (e.g. euthanasia, abortion).  By structuring the class in this manner, you realize that one false assumption made in a larger branch of ethics can affect conclusions reached in a smaller branch.  The class also encourages learning how to write good philosophy papers.  You are assigned three papers that are weighted increasingly more as the semester progresses (the first is 10 percent, the second 20 percent, and the third 30 percent), which provides you with good feedback in a low-stress environment.

Graded absurdly difficultly, and the lectures are no where near worth it.", "This class is really life changing, because it teaches you to think about our political system and legal system in a whole new way. It also teaches you how to be a careful thinker, and gives you the opportunity to grapple with really hard, important issues. This course is hard, because Professor George has really high standards, but it is definitely worth it.

Take it you're a POL major, take it if you are interested in government at all.", "This is the best course I have ever taken at Princeton. It will challenge you like nothing else, but if you have any interest in constitutional law, then this will be an amazing course for you.

You'll feel more informed about everything you read in the news. It is absolutely the best.", "Very difficult, but worth it.", "Very difficult, very worth it.", "While I don't necessarily agree with Prof. George on many substantive issues, I leave the course respecting him as a scholar and a professor (as many of his opponents do as well) - mostly because he's a terrific lecturer, not only in how he delivers the material, but also in how he manages the lecture hall, engaging the students in lively discussion and really making you think. The writing assignments were pretty difficult but a thrill to work on, as they dealt with really significant issues of our time (specifically: Obamacare, gay rights and freedom of speech, and abortion). Precepts run by Matt McCoy were great! I get the feeling that all precepts are excellent in this course. Readings, primarily from the thick casebook, were digestible and thought-provoking. Great class!", "YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE BEFORE GRADUATING.  Professor George is one of a kind.  Unbelievably good lecturer and preceptor.  Very well-designed course.  Non-ideological.  All sides of the subject matter are clearly presented.  If you want to take sides, you'd better have good reasons -- no matter which side you're on.  GREAT course.", "You can do all of the readings or get by doing none of the readings. Robbie George is a fantastic lecturer, and his political leanings do not bias his presentation of the material.

Professor Macedo is extremely engaging in lecture, and all of the preceptors (from what I've heard) are as well.

The class examines issues that matter to any and every conscious global/national citizen. Try to keep up with the readings, like 50% a week at least. The class is an average workload, but the issues are pertinent and pretty easily understandable so it's more fun doing the work for this class than most, I found.

I really think it was a great class. My favorite class this semester.", "The course is what Princeton is all about. Take it.", "The course material was basic, the lectures painfully dull and confusing at times, and the students enrolled overly competitive.  I am disappointed that this course may be the only exposure to ethics that many students going into fields in which justice and rights are of primary concern receive.", "The first half of the semester was great. The topics were torture and global justice and the lectures were helpful. However, after the midterm, the class became disorganized and we didn't get our assigned readings sufficient time in advance. he lectures are somewhat interactive, but they are dominated by the few people who really understand the complicated readings. Macedo had no intention of explaining the basic theories and ideas so that we could understand them so a lot of precept is spent understanding these basic ideas, which is fine. The debate format of precept is very interesting and I think is the best part of the class. James Linville was a great preceptor. The readings range from easy and short to philosophical and long. In general, they are manageable and interesting. The two papers (5 and 7 pages) are also manageable. The midterm and final are fair and have IDs and essays where you compare different models of thought on an application. All in all, this is a fairly interesting course if you are interested in torture, global justice, gay marriage, gender equality, etc. Not too much work...", "The papers can be difficult but are the best way to engage with the authors in order to fully understand their message as well as your own beliefs.", "The precepts are amazing. If nothing else, I would take this course to get a chance to debate during the precepts.", "There are probably better EMs to take", "There is a lot more work in this class than you think, and the papers are graded very harshly.

Make sure to pick your preceptor wisely as it will affect your experience with the course.", "There is a lot of reading, but it is manageable and stay on track with it. The preceptor for this class is fundamental in learning the concepts and make sure it is a right fit from the beginning.", "This course is very interesting. This course is one of those courses where you have to do every single reading. I recommend it if you have an interest in considering philosophical perspectives in relation to a variety of public issues.", "This course makes you think. It is worthwhile if you are interested in ethics and/or policy. Be prepared to read challenging readings, listen to interesting lectures and engage in good debates.", "This course may disappoint you. Take it only if you need the departmental.", "This is a good choice for an EM, though if you are not a WWS or POL major, it will be difficult to take it for a grade.", "This is a great course. It's very interesting and there is a wide variety in the readings (modern, policy, older, theoretical, etc.), which helps make it go by. The precepts are debate format and very fun. My preceptor was really great and I think they generally all are. Normal workload. Not too intimidating. Macedo and the preceptors offer a lot of help in office hours. It is very engaging and the two essays were super fun to write. Importantly, I think the exams were fair. Definitely would recommend the course.", "This is a really good class to take if you are interested in public policy. Remember that it is an upper division class and it is not going to be easy. But it gives you a good foundation of how morality and ethics play an important role in politics. I would suggest that you take advantage of office hours and ask questions when you don't understand something.", "This is probably not the easiest EM you could take, but I thought it was really interesting. Macedo is a great lecturer, and I feel like I really know the material.

However, lectures were often difficult to follow, as Prof. Snyder often speaks very quickly, not allowing students to fully absorb the information. Exams are, for the most part, relatively straightforward and tests the material learned in class. However, you must have a strong grasp of some parts of the material because the course isn't really curved (i.e., A = 90 , B = 80-89, etc.).

Splitting the final up into five exams was a good idea. It sounds like a lot of exams, but it keeps you on top of the material and frees up your reading period for the final project, which you absolutely need. Make sure your group includes people that you know you can work with well, don't mind staying up with, and get along with in general. A good work atmosphere can really make a difference. Start early on everything and ask a lot of questions, because specifics aren't always given in the project description. Try not to take other time-consuming courses in addition to this because you'll also be thesis-ing. It's also nice  to open up your schedule in order to be considerate of your group members and make sure that one person isn't stuck doing the bulk of the work. Good luck!", "Don't be scared. Prof. Floudas is pretty fair, takes feedback and works with you when you need to go to interviews, which is great!", "Fantastic lectures. Floudas is a phenomenal lecturer. He's engaging with a fast pace, the material is often interesting, and he really knows where people tend to mess up on things and purposefully addresses those things. Always in a good mood and makes you happy to be there.\n\nVery interesting and legit stuff. Not a lot of direct guidance, but that's kinda part of the whole assignment - so that you make your own way and come up with your own approaches.\n\nThe readings are fairly directly related to the lectures and are good to go through before lecture - makes lectures easier to keep up with (especially for a slow writer). Sometimes useful for assignments.\n\nI really liked this course. Took a lot of time and effort, for sure, but it felt very legit and was super worth it.

I mean, a couple all-nighters, but what's that in the long run, amirite? \nAlso, Professor Floudas is a good professor - he explains things well, and he cares that you understand them. If you don't understand something and ask him after class, he will explain it until you do. He also completely restructured our class after the complaints from last year, so you know that he cares about how his students feel. He really just wants the best for us, but actually, though.

A good chunk of the first half of the semester is wasted on two operas: A Life for the Tsar, and Ruslan and Lyudmila, so if you don't have a burning desire to learn about Glinka, this class is not for you. Course material aside, there were so many things wrong with this class that I hardly know where to begin. Firstly, the structure is terrible: three oral quizzes (30% of the grade) that require a minimum of 12 hours listening prep each; 2 papers (45%), for which no topic is given and little direction is to be obtained from the instructor; class participation (25%). Secondly, if Professor Zavlunov is teaching, the seminar will not be an enjoyable experience. Although courteous enough in office hours, the professor did not seem to like his students and, indeed, the classroom dynamic was one of barely disguised hostility. Hardly the sort of thing that would foster a meaningful discussion in seminar! Thirdly, the sheer amount of knowledge that is expected in this course is overwhelming, even for someone with a decent background in music theory. You need to have a firm grasp of European operatic convention, not to mention general music history, in order to do well here. Moreover, a lot of complex musical terminology (i.e. chromatic mediants, octatonic collections, French 4/3 chords) is employed in lectures, and the professor is not too receptive to questions about such vocabulary. I suppose this course does provide a relatively good survey of Russian music, although several key areas (i.e. radical music in the 1920s) were skipped because too much time was wasted on Glinka. Yet in the end, I really wish that I had dropped the course before it was too late. This was by far the most painful course I've taken at Princeton and it almost single-handedly ruined my semester.

And take it! Attend every class!", "Do outside research on the musicals and try to understand the different readings of each.", "I originally took this class because I needed an LA and had a very basic interest in musical theater. I ended up being extremely engaged in the course (I even did a lot of outside readings!). Professor Wolff's lectures were sometimes a bit disorganized, but always chock full of extremely interesting information. She also somehow knew everyone in the class (including people not in her precept), and really cared about both the material and us. The assignments were very interesting and made me think more about the topics. The readings were phenomenal (you only read musical theater scripts). This is kind of weird, but I almost wish there was a tiny bit *more* secondary source reading, to elucidate everything more. Roy was one of the best preceptors I've ever had in my life. He was balanced, fair, and made sure everyone had a chance to talk. He always brought out the best in the precept. Overall, the class was superb -- easily one of my favorites. I especially appreciated that you didn't need any prior knowledge regarding musical theater. I only had one small quibble: I think the class would have been improved if we covered less OR had precepts twice a week. We had so much to say on one show that we never had enough time to discuss the other show in precept. One possible way this could be fixed is to read the show on Tuesday and read a few secondary source articles on Thursday. Alternatively, we could just do one show a week and have precept twice a week.", "I would advise other students to find a set time to watch/read the musicals every week; if not, they may find themselves waking up at 8AM the morning before class trying to cram it in, especially if there are two musicals in one week (that's like 6 hours!).", "If you are interested in musical theater, take this course.  It is relatively easy to keep up with the workload and the grading is very friendly, but there are probably more intellectually stimulating courses.", "If you're not in Triangle or another theatre group on campus (or obsessed with musicals) this course turns out to be more challenging than it should be. It is a survey course but is treated like everything needs to be learned in depth (i.e. you're expected to listen to every song of every play) and so is not what it is advertised to be. If you love musicals go for it but for general interest another survey class might be the way to go.", "It's fun if you like musicals, but you're not going to learn a lot and you should check who's precepting.", "Record lectures and be sure not to miss any. Work very hard to communicate with your professor and preceptor as sometimes there can be trouble.

Tamsen's lectures are really enlightening, and accessible even if you're not a \"theatre person.\"", "Take it, take it! Tamsen is a genius!", "Take this class!", "Take this course if you are at all interested in musical theatre.", "Take this course! Enjoy readings the musicals. Keep notes on the musicals as you read them, participate in precept, and don't forget to ask for feedback on your drafts and written assignments.

Great lectures and such good material.", "This was by far my favorite class of the semester.  Tamsen is a great lecturer and I learned how to think in a way that will help me think about other works in the future.  She's very good at responding to drafts and email, but hard to track down in person.  However, that didn't get in my way.
