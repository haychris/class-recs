I approached the course with a high level of enthusiasm, but it quickly petered out as I realized that the course was poorly taught and I didn't enjoy the material. Reinhardt's lectures were sporadic at best. Almost all of the time, he left the actual course material to the preceptors to teach in precept. Lectures were full of corny and borderline racist jokes. Occasionally, there would be an informative lecture, but these were few and far between. Problem sets were moderately helpful. Feedback was slight. Grading across the precepts was extremely inconsistent. Examinations were torturous. The book is very helpful, but Reinhardt constantly makes fun of the book for being too simple. That was one of my biggest pet peeves with the course: Reinhardt assumes that you know the material in the textbook already and builds off of that (in a very bombastic way) in lecture. I was under the impression that this was an introductory course.. and I was wrong. Precepts were extremely helpful, though. Overall, I hated this course. A different instructor is greatly needed.

The problem sets can be somewhat annoying, but if you work in groups you should be fine.", "Professor Reinhardt is a really funny lecturer.  However, he doesn't teach anything.  The hour and a half lectures are a complete waste of time.  His lectures are often pointless and constantly off topic, but then he gives us these crazy hard problem sets that we have no idea how to do.  He constantly tells us how stupid he thinks our textbook is, and only about half of what we've covered is even in the textbook.  So, he doesn't teach anything in class, and then we also don't have a textbook to go reference to help us understand things.  \n\nAnd don't count on precepts to help you learn anything.  The precept was even more pointless than lecture.\n\nIf you take this course, go to the study hall at McGraw.  It was SO SO helpful and the only way I learned anything in this course.", "Professor Reinhardt is a very entertaining lecturer.

This is a good introductory course to economics as it covered a lot.", "Really interesting course, but it is humanly impossible to do all of the readings.  Just learn as much as you have to or as you can, but definitely take it if you are interested in the economics world.", "Reinhardt can be an interesting man (and obviously has some worthwhile thoughts on life), but I would not recommend taking ECO100 with him unless you are pdf'ing (and therefore are not very concerned about the course's unpredictable grading; I did fine on the midterm and still pdf'ed because of how erratic the grading feels) or enjoy excessive amounts of finance material.

I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed the course at all without him.", "Reinhardt is funny and really smart (clearly). His stated purpose, however, is to teach to the top third of the class. This can be a nice challenge. But if the extra content is not worth the extra work for you, you might want to take it with a different professor.", "Reinhardt is funny, and a solid lecturer. Class was not too hard. Don't take it if the lectures are an hour and a half- waste of time.", "Reinhardt is hilarious and brilliant, take this class.", "Reinhardt is really really hard. He seems like a really nice guy, and he's absolutely hilarious, but the lectures are really quick and often confusing. I took this for a distribution requirement, and I wished I hadn't.

It is material that is good to know, but don't expect too much.", "The topics of the course are very useful to your day-to-day way of thinking, but the way Reinhardt taught them, you either find the lectures very funny and engaging, or rather frustrating and off-track. I felt more on the latter side, because I would prefer more content to be taught and less side-stories that seems less relevant.", "This class is labelled as an Introduction to Microeconomics, yet the class that I took was far from an introductory level class. Professor Reinhardt himself said that he would be shocked if anyone in the class was entirely new to economics. But isn't that the exact point of these type of classes?? This class needs to refocus its goal to provide a basic level of understanding at an introductory level, and have vested interest in teaching its students, rather than trying to stump them.", "This class was too hard with Uwe. He's so sweet and hilarious and enthusiastic, but he should be really teaching a higher level class.", "This course is fine but did not spark any strong interest in economics.", "This course is general introduction, so it might not be as challenging for some students, especially those with strong math backgrounds.

Take it!", "This is a good course if you are interested in economics, but don't take it just to fulfill a distribution requirement.", "This is a good course, but not a great one. It is good to do the reading before class so that you can understand how what the professor says fits into the bigger picture. Some of the info is cool and relevant, and other parts of it are not.", "This is a great introductory economics course.", "This is a pretty standard Princeton introductory course. If you have Reinhardt teaching it, you will certainly enjoy lecture. Some people did not like his focus on his personal knowledge of the US health care system, and his addition of information on corporate finance, but I found this information the most interesting and relevant, so if this interests you, Reinhardt is the professor you want. Otherwise, a very decent course.", "This is an excellent class to PDF.

It can be difficult at times, but is well worth it.", "I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks they are more of a logic person than a linguistic person.  It was stimulating and interesting without being too time consuming.", "I would say that this is a great course and it is definitely worth taking for any person in any concentration.  It does a great job of teaching the basics of programming and is a really useful course. You definitely need to take the time to do the readings and the homework if you are new to programming but if you do that you will succeed.", "I would take the course if you're even remotely interesting in computer science. It's really interesting and taught very well.", "If it isn't a requirement for you and you're just taking it to fulfill a general requirement, then you might have to put in more work than you would in other courses that could fulfill the same requirement. The material is cool though.", "If other kids are taking this class, I would recommend staying on top of it because it gets exponentially harder.", "If you are interested in learning programming, take this course! It is a great introduction to programming, and exams are fair. Help is always available if you need it in understanding the material; students are encouraged to post questions on a site called Piazza if they need help,which are answered by preceptors in usually 15 minutes or less.", "If you have any interest at all, or even wouldn't mind the programming mindset, take this course. It is one of the best Princeton has to offer. Take it.", "If you have experience with Java programming, take this course for an easy A. Start the assignments BEFORE the semester starts (they are all online) regardless of your experience in programming. It'll help.", "If you have patience and want to learn a useful skill, definitely take it. It is a very rewarding class.", "If you have taken AP Computer Science before then you are set for the first half of the course for the most part, but don't let this make you think that you can skip classes for the rest of the semester because there are many things that are covered in class that you will never have been exposed to later on in the semester.", "If you have the time to put in it's a great way to learn basic Java, but be prepared for more work than you might expect.", "If you have to take it, you have to take it. If you have a decent amount of free time and youre looking for another class,  this is an awesome fit.", "If you need a QR and aren't afraid to do a little work, definitely take this class. It's well taught and organized, and very interesting.", "If you want to do anything at all related to math or science, take it. It'll be interesting and rewarding. Even if you don't like sciences, it's still a really good course - that gives you real-world skills", "If you want to learn about basic java, then take this class! It's also a good, extremely pertinent to any career choice, way to fulfill your QR requirement.", "If you're interested in COS at all, 126 is a good introduction. If you're coming in with no experience at all, it will be quite challenging but still a good option.", "If you're taking this class for interest, make sure you have plenty of time to spend on the class or you already have sufficient coding experience. If you're taking this class because you're required, make sure your schedule isn't too difficult as is. You need lots of time for this course.", "If you've had any experience programming, this class will be infinitely easier. Otherwise, be prepared for an awful lot of frustration and feeling like a moron after spending way too long on things that you later realized were not that difficult - you were just thinking about it in the wrong way.", "It is a great class if you have never been exposed to computer science before. It is challenging, but fun.", "It is a great course to take, and definitely useful! Definitely do the readings as the exams are more than just knowing how to program something.", "It might seem like a scary course, but once you get the hang of things and understand the official \"slang,\" it actually turns into a very enjoyable and rewarding class.", "It's a good intro class that doesn't require prior knowledge. It's definitely an advantage for the first half of the semester if you have prior knowledge in COS, but the playing field levels out in the second half. It's worth taking!", "It's an interesting course.", "It's tough, but it's definitely worth all the work you put into it!", "Its a cool and interesting course, but a lot lot of work. like 10 hours a week or more and I was pdfing. So take it if you have a knack for logic or computer science, or really want to learn this stuf- otherwise be warned.", "Keep up with the material and start early on programs!", "Keep up with the work.", "Make sure you understand everything in the course.

Please do go to lab hours and ask other people for questions. The assignments are really hard to finish by oneself. Overall, very well designed and taught course.", "Take it if you have a lot of time/are going to PDF it. Do anything and try to get into Christopher Moretti's precept.

It's a fun and appropriately challenging way to explore the basics of computer science, the greatest subject ever.", "Take the class, take it seriously.", "Take this class if you're interested in the subject matter. If you haven't programmed before, be prepared to put in a frustrating 10 hours a week, but it's definitely worth it in the end.", "Take this class! I had no programming experience whatsoever, but it was not very difficult. It is very easy to get help on assignments if you don't understand them.

Should be required.", "Take this class. Do it.", "Take this course", "Take this course - even if you're not BSE - and don't be scared by the amount of time it can take. You'll learn a lot. PDF it if you must, but don't not take it because of the time commitment.", "Take this course as early as you can!  It's fun, but time consuming.", "Take this course!", "Take this course! EVERYONE should take it, AB and BSE students.

Keep up with the assignments and read the book when you are confused and you will be fine. The assignments are fun and I had my mind blown in lecture multiple times (try to take it when Doug Clark is lecturing).", "Take this course, love it, move on to be a COS major or just move in life knowing that you now have the tool of Computer Science just in case you ever need it.  Go to precepts, they are extremely helpful, go to lecture because they are extremely cool, do extra work because if you love COS it will be worth it, and don't shirk the fundamentals on the way because they will come back to bite you.", "Take this course.  The material was extremely interesting, widely applicable, and well presented.", "Take this course. You will learn a lot and feel a huge sense of accomplishment when completing assignments.", "Take this course. You will need to dedicate a lot of time to this course if you have never programmed before or you are not a tech-savvy, science- and math-type person, but it is super cool and you will learn a lot about how the tools we use every day (like the computer that you are reading this review on) function.", "Take this course??it's really interesting and rewarding.

This is a fun class.", "The class is very interesting and easy to follow as long as you keep up with all of the work.  It's alot of fun, everybody should take it", "The course moves very fast and should be one of your focus courses. Repetition and spending time by yourself programming is really the only way to do well in the class, not to mention reading everything, and especially doing so before lectures. Use the help they provide, because sometimes with other demanding classes it's hard to do well without.", "There is a steep learning curve for students who haven't taken any computer science classes before (like myself) so don't fall behind!  Take advantage of lab TA hours.", "This class is amazing. My preceptor, Professor Gabai, was simply outstanding, though all of the other preceptors seem nice as well. Be sure to attend all lectures and precepts and get started on homework early. If you have questions, be sure to stop by office hours during the week. Also, the lab TAs are really nice and helpful when it comes to debugging.", "This class is fantastic: everyone should take it, regardless of major.", "This class takes a lot more time than you would expect and will be much more difficult if you are not also enrolled in other similar engineering classes, or classes with a programming component.", "This course does a good job of explaining the basics of Java and computer science.  The workload starts of pretty light but picks up in the last few weeks.", "This course is an introduction to programming and it starts off slowly with common programming idioms, but takes off with the N-body simulation assignment. Since some people have strong computer science backgrounds already, it may be frustrating to see them done with assignments before you've even finished understanding the instructions, but this course is definitely worth taking.", "This course is well worth taking.", "This course was a great intro to comp sci. I came in with no experience and want to major in it now!", "This has to be one of the best courses at Princeton, or at least in the quantitative subjects. At first I was afraid that I would do poorly because everyone else was so experienced (or at least that was my perception), but it was not true. I came in with no programming experience but an interest in the subject, and now I might get a COS certificate (I'm not an engineer). This class is definitely doable and help is abundant.", "This is a course that has a lot of work. The difficulty of the work depends on your experience in programming and/or your ability to think like a programmer. The is a good deal of computer science (as in not programming stuff) also involved in the course that is not easy. The course teaches very relevant and useful skill that most students should know.", "This is a good class if you're willing/ready to spend a good bit of time - this is not going to be your highest grade ever though.", "This is a good class, but don't be lured into thinking this is an easy class by the first half of the semester. The second half is much more difficult than the first.", "This is a great class in a very useful subject. Even if you have no interest in computer science, it will teach you skills that will be useful in truly any field. The projects are fun and challenging and the material is very broad.", "This is a great course to learn COS. You will need to do the reading and do the programs.", "This is a great, challenging and well organized class to take", "This is a really enjoyable course! I knew no computer science before it, and while it was challenging, it was certainly doable. Do be ready to work hard. I would recommend taking this with three, not four, other classes if you can. Start programming assignments early- you usually know all you need to program six days before the assignment is due. You don't know how long the assignment will take, and office hours are much more relaxed earlier than they are the night before an assignment is due. Look at practice written exams (they're on the website) from really early on- they require a different skill set from programming assignments. Being aware of what will be expected of you from the start will help you ensure you're ready for these tests and can approach each lecture with the mindset that you want to learn how to program (helpful on assignments) and that you want to learn how things work/nuances/how to read code and know what it will do (helpful on exams, but since exams happen less often than assignments [two exams, ten programming assignments in the semester], easier to neglect). The rigors are well worth it. On a practical level, having coding experience is very valuable for future coursework and careers- it can open many doors. Thinking in a COS mindset teaches you logical, analytical thought processes that have many applications outside of Java programming. Also, you realize the beauty, elegance, and power of computers, which is very fulfilling and will broaden your horizons. I feel like this should almost be a graduation requirement and strongly recommend it!", "This is a really good, well-taught class that teaches the basics of computer programming. It is, however, a bit on the tough side, especially later in the semester, and probably isn't for everyone. At least skim the reading for every class, don't start assignments one or two days before they're due, and if you're struggling, don't hesitate to go to office hours or email your preceptor.", "This is a very good QR to take, especially if you have interest in computers. It's probably more difficult if you have no knowledge of programming.", "This is an amazingly well-run course, and I don't know anybody who disliked it. Go to the lectures! Even if the lecturer just seems to be reading the slides to you, it will help enormously.", "This is really challenging!! Don't sign up for it casually if you have no talent in computer science.

You obviously need it to be a major and pretty much need it if you want a certificate, but it's a solid course in terms of teaching you all of the major data structures and algorithms. The workload is manageable -- the programming assignments can take some time, but it's all partner programming and can be finished in a day if necessary. Other than that, the grading is fair and the material is taught well. The lectures can sometimes get boring, especially since they're 80 minutes, but paying attention is useful.", "If you liked COS126, then you'll like COS226.

You will get a handle on both ideas and equations, which will equip you with a full grasp of the material that is valuable for when you will have to use what you learned in the future. The presentation does a nice job of interweaving concepts and calculations, so each one helps you better understand the other. (For instance, you think what a temperature increase might do to a system, and then you examine an equation with temperature, which confirms your prediction.) Getting to have interactive lectures, where you problem-solve with the people around you, gives you a great taste of what thinking like a scientist is like. Make sure you have not only read the book, but have also pinpointed what you want to learn more about/would like further clarification on, since the more you prepare, the more you get out of lectures. Exam-wise, in keeping with the spirit of the course, be sure you can do calculations (problem sets help, and ask if practice problems can be posted) and also that you understand the key ideas at play (reviewing lecture notes is valuable in this respect, and often the book?s conceptual questions help). If you are good on both these fronts, the exam will likely go well. Professor Kelly is eager to help students and very good at explaining concepts, so be sure to ask questions and attend office hours.

I count it as one of the most valuable academic experiences I have ever had, and I've come out of it with a completely new perspective on physics and the sciences in general, but that being said, it's not for everyone. It really defined my freshman year academic experience, as I could pretty much categorize my workload into 80% Integrated and 20% everything else, so (as other people have probably already told you), you should be prepared for a very challenging amount of work. During the year I definitely had a love/hate relationship with it, but having come to the end I've realized that I've gained a lot of skills and knowledge that I would not have gotten with a standard freshman introductory science course load (experience with MATLAB and Latex, exposure to genetics and computer science/bioinformatics, etc). I think that a lot of alumni either wax poetic about Integrated or just come off as completely cautionary, so I think the best thing to do is to talk to a lot of people who have taken it, maybe ask to see some psets and lab reports to get a sense of the workload, and just enroll and see what it's all about for the first few days.

The first semester started out really, really tough, but we eventually learned how to manage the material, understood it better, and in the end it felt like a rewarding, learning experience.  The collaboration was great, the examinations were fair, and we all felt like a family, and to be honest, that didn?t change this semester.  If you were annoyed by the laboratory grading, it got better this semester and the labs themselves, aside from an optics lab that was barely comprehensible, was actually decent.  However, the problem sets became very, VERY obnoxiously difficult, oftentimes asking questions that couldn?t be even attempted individually.  This was compounded by the lecture notes that couldn?t be learned from.  The first semester had great Bialek-style notes that, while confusing at first, did a great job in walking us through the steps of the material.  These notes did none of that, throwing us mostly garbled information that was almost impossible to study from.  As a result, the examinations later in the year were completely impossible.  When the examination average is below 50%, that?s not our fault ? it?s the professors? fault.  ISC thinks its your only course, but you have other schoolwork (especially if you have Spring Writing Seminar) and there is practically zero time for it.

There's very little effort made to teach it to you, but you do all of the labs in Verilog. As a result, a good chunk of the lab time is spent debugging a language you don't fully understand.

Very interactive lecturer, even with 50-60 people in the classroom and good about answering questions in office hours or on Piazza.\n\nA tad more work than can fit in the 3 hour lab block.  You do labs on your own time (3-4 hours/week during the beginning of the semester, more towards the end) and then have to demo to the TAs during one of the scheduled demo/help sessions.  Starting the labs early (definitely before the demo sessions) is a really good strategy, as the demo sessions get very crowded.  The last two labs are multi-week final projects and are really fun!\n\nHomework is not too bad - although it varies a bit from week to week so again start early.  You are supposed to work with a different person every week, which I did, but I don't think they checked.  Exams are also decent although generally more in-depth design questions than you will see on the homework, so they are hard to practice for.\n\nLoved this class and I'd recommend it to any COS majors interested in systems and seeing what happens between the hardware and where 217 ends.

Doing the reading is a good idea, since you'll be better equipped to contribute to precept discussions. Do be aware that the reading can occasionally be time-consuming, but if you spread it out, you shouldn't be overwhelmed. Both the amount of pages and the writing style can vary each week. Try to get familiar with why each book is used earlier on so you can figure out what you want out of it. For instance, some books will have a bit of analysis but be mostly used in this course to give background, so while you could analyze them, that might not be the most productive.

Also, you don't have to be a science person to do well or enjoy the class, as it is not like a biology class (at least in the sense that NEU 258 could sometimes be).\nIn terms of advice: read the textbook (I think this is 20% of the test material), but really focus on the higher level points (you might want to use the key terms as a proxy for this). Go to lecture (you're missing out otherwise, and there's just so much material. Also Professor Botvinick does a really good job of filling in the gaps. Just looking at the PowerPoint slides it might be unclear why the slides are in the order they are in (e.g. why do we study semantic dementia after dyslexias?). Professor Botvinick fills in these transitions well). Enjoy.\n\nFinally, a note on precepts: Precepts might have been the highlight of this course for me (thanks Sarah!).

Overall an enjoyable experience, it would be a mistake by anyone to not take this class during their undergraduate years.", "This is my favorite course I've taken so far at Princeton. I was lucky to be able to get in to it as a sophomore. Gleason is a fantastic lecturer. His PowerPoints don't have much text and he doesn't post them online, so you can't get away with just copying everything, you have to listen, but his lectures are well organized and easy to follow, and he does post a lot of other content online for your use/pleasure. His PowerPoints were entertaining, with incorporated music, video, and great images. Though he's been teaching this class for awhile, he kept the lectures very up-to-date with new articles, videos, news, etc. from within the past months, weeks, or even days, bringing up nearly every appropriation of the works of children's literature we were reading (including movies that haven't even come out yet). He arranged for a special Hunger Games viewing for the class and also two special Cotsen Library sessions, where you get to look at rare, old children's books, often first editions.\n\nADVICE: This is a FUN class NOT a blow off class! DO take it to pay attention and have a great time, DON'T take it just to sit in lecture and play computer games. 1) It's too fantastic of a class to blow off so if that is your intent, please give your spot to someone else. 2) You can't write the papers and do well on the exam if you never pay attention or do the readings (the exam identifications were tricky but doable IF you truly paid attention/did the readings). And not all of the reading is children's books; some of it is denser secondary source material.\n\nGleason is both a great teacher and a great guy. He even structured the class so that there would be less readings around the time that seniors were finishing their theses. In the end, I really don?t see how anyone (who does more than just sit there and play video games) couldn?t find this class entertaining and fun, so don?t waste the opportunity!", "This is the best class I've taken at Princeton and Gleason is an amazing professor. There's not too much work, and all of the reading is incredibly enjoyable.", "This is the best class to PDF, because you get to learn all about a cool subject, but it's fine if you don't do well on the final exam.", "This was an amazing class to take in my situation (senior spring P/D/F), but I'd imagine it would be amazing in any situation. I looked forward to lecture and to our readings every week, and Gleason delivered something special each and every time. Take it if you get the chance.", "This was one of my favorite classes at Princeton (and I am not even an English major). This class offers fiction and critical analysis with a dash of nostalgia!

The professors have such different styles and the material is diff as well. This one focuses more on arrow-pushing mechanisms, the effect of electron withdrawing groups, and the carbonyl group, while Semmelhack's class has to think about all of that and how it relates to enzymes and proteins and such.

As a result, each assignment, which should have been an interesting hardware or software project, took needlessly long and in the end, did not teach anything. To make matters worse, for a lot of these projects, the instructor did not even bother to implement them or throughly debug them beforehand to make sure he understood the ins and outs before giving the assignment to students. Thus, students were often led to dead ends where hours upon hours were spent on an assignment that could not actually work. It was also extremely frustrating to e-mail the instructor only to find out that he himself had never actually done the assignment before and so, could not offer any concrete help. The course assignments were pretty much all meaningless and again, did not teach anything. I think this course seriously lacked direction.

If you have not taken OS before, the programming assignments will probably be pretty difficult for you and you'll be very aware that many of your fellow students have more experience with C programming than you, but this can be overcome by just getting started on the assignments early and being unafraid to ask for help or clarifications.", "Attend lectures! Jennifer Rexford presents things in an incredibly reasonable / logical way, and is much more engaging than the textbook. You actually learn from the lectures and it is much harder to \"just catch up\" from the book afterward.", "Be comfortable with C, get some other cos classes in first and start the assignments early.", "Definitely recommended for every COS student!", "Do not take with 4 other courses. Otherwise, it's a fairly cool course.", "Get ready for some C.", "Go to all of the lectures, and study for the exams.", "Great class overall. Maybe good to take OS before. Not a strict requirement, but helpful for programming kinda. Assignments can be time-consuming so allocate enough time.", "Great course if you want to learn how the internet works. Rexford is an awesome lecturer and spends a good amount of time on useful anecdotes illustrating how the topics we learn in class apply to real-world systems. As for the work- the midterm is fair and most of the assignments are very reasonable WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION OF THE ROUTER. Please, please, please start the router assignment early. You'll be happy you did.", "Hard class.

It is a very good systems course that exercises C programming and teaches many key concepts that arise in computer systems.", "If Rexford is teaching this class, you must take it.", "If you are interested in learning about the way the internet works at its heart, then I recommend taking this course. Programming assignments are not conceptually difficult but they do require quite a bit of coding.", "If you love systems and hacking, go for it.

You can almost learn everything you need to know about network.", "There's an interesting contrast between the assignments and the lectures and exams in this course. The assignments are very detailed (manipulating bits or endianness) and focused on a specific element of a network (a router or a proxy).  Meanwhile the rest of the course is a broad overview of the ideas and general strategies used in various forms of networking. Overall I'd say take the course, go to lecture (probably skip the readings), and start early on the assignments, especially the router.", "This class is relatively easy, but the projects take a long time. They are not a waste of time, however. After you do them you will understand how to do network programming.", "This course was great.  I would highly recommend it.", "This is a fantastic course and Professor Rexford teaches it really really well. Even if you are only slightly interested in networks, I suggest you consider taking it.", "This is a very challenging class, but the material is interesting and relevant.  Take it, but be sure to start the assignments early and get help as soon as you need it.", "This is a very useful course.", "This is an excellent course, but a quite challenging one. The programming assignments are substantial, but the most difficult part of class is mastering an absolutely staggering amount of material about every area of Networks: it requires quite a bit of effort to avoid 'losing the forest for the trees'.

On the one hand, Professor Blix was adept at running our class meetings.  I appreciated his insights, his friendliness and flexibility, and the general outline he followed for each session.

I thought this was a good balance, because I find three hours of dithering about a single paragraph tedious.\n---One concern I have relates to the corpus for this course.  In my opinion, the texts we read should have already been familiar to French majors.  In this capstone of our undergraduate careers, I think we could have spent one day talking about two or three of them, and incorporated other texts into the course (secondary sources, maybe?  Most of us were not pure literature majors but also studied history, politics, religion...).  I realize the course was primarily to serve as preparation for our comprehensive exams, which are limited to these works and will presumably delve deeply into their meanings and messages, but I would have liked to be exposed to texts I was less aware of, too. Especially lacking to me was a broader discussion of historiography and literary theory/aesthetics.  My favorite class meeting was the first because we talked about theories of literature and historical viewpoints surrounding genres and periods.  To me, discussing themes that occur in individual books is what I have been doing for the past four years (in classes with a coherent corpus of texts).  This course was an opportunity to sum up what the study of French literature means to scholars and to undergraduate students, and I think it missed the mark on that score.

The first semester started out really, really tough, but we eventually learned how to manage the material, understood it better, and in the end it felt like a rewarding, learning experience.  The collaboration was great, the examinations were fair, and we all felt like a family, and to be honest, that didn?t change this semester.  If you were annoyed by the laboratory grading, it got better this semester and the labs themselves, aside from an optics lab that was barely comprehensible, was actually decent.  However, the problem sets became very, VERY obnoxiously difficult, oftentimes asking questions that couldn?t be even attempted individually.  This was compounded by the lecture notes that couldn?t be learned from.  The first semester had great Bialek-style notes that, while confusing at first, did a great job in walking us through the steps of the material.  These notes did none of that, throwing us mostly garbled information that was almost impossible to study from.  As a result, the examinations later in the year were completely impossible.  When the examination average is below 50%, that?s not our fault ? it?s the professors? fault.  ISC thinks its your only course, but you have other schoolwork (especially if you have Spring Writing Seminar) and there is practically zero time for it.

In part, this is due to the nature of the subject - colonial America is \"kind of a big deal\".  I also really appreciated Prof. Warren's projected neutrality in terms of ethical considerations.  Often, I find that historians of sensitive (let's say) material at Princeton have not always provided us students with a rationale for what, why, and when we are studying, but will without justifying it present one interpretation as the gold standard, ignoring others we may have encountered in the past.  Even though Prof. Warren may have a horse in this race, I always felt that we approached both colonizer and colonized in a balanced way: we learned the history, its ramifications and the views of prominent historians, but we were free to form our own conclusions.  We explicitly addressed old modes of thinking about colonization and why they don't work anymore.  -In terms of looking for ways to improve the course, I would suggest having students select readings for their papers at the beginning of the semester.

Sato Sensei, Shibata Sensei, Tameyori Sensei, and Tokumasu Sensei are all dynamic and wonderful professors who care about their students.\nI don't think I've ever received such thorough language training before. The professors were very concerned with developing all aspects of our language abilities, including reading, speaking, listening, and writing. I felt myself improving in all of those areas as a result of specific assignments such as free speaking recordings and translation assignments. The homework assignments were challenging, but helpful. I appreciated that the professors assigned only the most helpful parts of the workbook. They largely avoided redundancy and \"busy work\".\n\nTl;dr-- If you have ANY interest at all in taking Japanese, I strongly recommend this class. You will enjoy it and learn lots, I promise.", "The course moves very fast, so always keep up with grammar and assignments, and get questions clarified right away. Go to office hours often, and also get to know the instructors and classmates by going to the Japanese Table for dinner.

It helps to make connections with classmates, because you can easily find partners for speaking activities, and the classes become so much more fun.", "This course has the best instructors available for learning this language anywhere in the world.
