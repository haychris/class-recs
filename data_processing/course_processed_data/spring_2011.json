Well, now imagine that the vector in is one dimension, two dimension, three dimension, four dimension, five dimensions. Suddenly you can't visualize it any more. Then add the kernel, a complex contraption that requires you to find vectors perpendicular to other vectors, and everything becomes a jumbled mess. And that's only the tip of the iceberg.

The midterms and finals are also ridiculously hard. They teach you a simple concept in class, they go two or three levels deeper on the exam and expect you to solve it.

For exams, I would recommend going over the lecture notes, reading Organic Chemistry as a Second Language II (as opposed to the Sorrell textbook), and completing all of the practice exams from previous years. I would also recommend going to the weekly McGraw review sessions, especially if they're held by Keith Reber (he's awesome!).", "It is far too much work to have your GPA get destroyed.

Lab will probably seem easier now due to the experience, but the lab reports just get longer and more tedious. The exams get harder as well, but this is probably just a reflection of the nature of the material (304 is all about mechanisms, so the latter end of 303 is a good foundation if you were solid with Sn1/Sn2/E1/E2 stuff). You get less than half the number of practice exams as you got in 303...which could be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it.

Absolutely no time was devoted to applications (which is surprising given the widespread use of graph theory in computer science), making everything we learned seem pretty useless.\n\nProfessor Seymour was an okay lecturer--he was well-prepared and very knowledgeable about the material.\n\nIt was great that he stopped every so often to ask something like \"why is this true?\" or \"how should we start proving this?\"\nHowever, this bonus to his teaching quality was offset by the fact that most of the time, the same one or students (who pretty much already knew the course material) would answer the questions, so the professor would just move on, assuming everyone else knew it.\n\nHe often went to fast, and was not good at answering questions.  He had no conception of the material's difficulty, and no particular regard for the students who were struggling with it.\n\nThe problem sets were very long and difficult, and pretty much impossible to do without extra help from the TAs.\n\nIt would have been much better to have problems which more closely follow the material from that week's lectures, and which are more doable.", "Don't expect it to be very applied.

The exams aren't very hard, although there's a lot of memorization of dates of pieces and composers' births and deaths for no apparent reason.  The best part is Simon Morrison's lectures, he makes everything very engaging and actually gives wonderfully interesting background stories about the composers and so forth.  It's a bit disheartening to see people get up after the 50 minutes when he's in the middle of talking, but if you stick around you'll hear some neat information from a very much prominent musicologist.

I personally recommend taking COS 226 first; 217 assignments are conceptually simple, but can get annoying in implementing so just make sure you have good programming experience. Also, I highly recommend taking this with ELE 206! They complement each other well: COS 217 work down from high level programming to registers, whereas ELE 206 help build up the fundamentals up to registers. \nOnce you take this class, just make sure to start assignments early, and you will literally love this class!", "Take this course!  It is challenging and time-consuming, but I learned an enormous amount and after both the assignments and the exams felt really satisfied that I had done well and achieved something. If you thought TOY in 126 was super-cool, or are interested in how things work in the computer when you compile a program or run a command, definitely check this course out.\n\nThis is a very very well-done course.  Lectures, precepts, assignments, and exams are all put together with care. Professor Rexford was a particularly amazing lecturer, but I have heard that all the ones for 217 are good. Chris Moretti, the head preceptor this semester, was almost always at his computer, ready to answer questions on the Piazzza discussion board. He also was very good at explaining the material.\n\nThe assignments are challenging and time-consuming, especially in the second half of the semester as you move to assembly (which is horrible to debug). Take the course with friends; there are two partner assignments near the end and having study buddies for the midterm and final is really useful.\n\nI did not take 226 before taking this course and never felt like I needed anything from that class that other people knew.  The two cover very different topics.\n\nStart early on assignments (like every COS course). But actually. Especially the last one. I didn't, and I saw a lot of pretty sunrises before Dean's Date. Don't do that.  The Dean's Date assignment takes perhaps 4x as long as the one before it.  \n\nSome advise to consider: Don't program in a room alone.  Obviously you must be very careful of the course policies when talking to friends and classmates, but a few people all staring at screens and complaining about hats/PuTTy makes a late night coding a lot more bearable.  Go to the COS lab TA's if you're confused on things. Go to the ACM's Code@Night to get food for those late night coding sessions and hear a junior or senior explain conceptually what in the world a double pointe", "Take this course:\n- if you're going for a COS major/certificate (duh)\n- if you really, really like low-level programming and don't mind spending a lot of time debugging.\n\nThat's it, really.

He also was extremely afraid of students, as evidenced by his awkwardness during office hours and his unwillingness to direct his gaze towards them during lectures.  The problem sets were unreasonably long and difficult - I took ECO311 and ECO363 in conjunction with this class this semester, both of which are recognized as being much difficult classes than ECO341, and yet I spent three times as much time working on 1 ECO341 problem set per week than I did working on both of those classes *combined.*  The material isn't that interesting either, unless *sorta* learning about Medicare and Social Security from a highly theoretical yet unrealistic point of view is the type of things that floats your boat.
