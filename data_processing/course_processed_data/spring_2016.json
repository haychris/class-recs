The textbook is virtually useless;  buy it electronically three, four ways or whatever and save money if you and others really want it. Review, review, review the solutions to the problem sets and understand step by step on how you came to an answer as it is critical in cultivating a deeper understanding. The course seems like its easy, don't be fooled. Recognize how even with Rosen, you only understand superficially and highly theoretically at those moments when you think you get it. Microeconomics seems like \"oh its common sense\" but if you don't practice with pen and paper, you will choke come test time.  Make a study group especially for the final. If you are a freshman listen to this: Plan accordingly on who the lecturer is 1) Avoid Reinhart like the plague. I've sat-in in his lectures and have listened to many of his victims; he is awful to have if you are not an economics genius (in which case you should not be taking this class and should have gotten a 5 on the AP test). 2) Bogan is okay. I know from six plus weeks of experience. She doesn't really teach during her lectures. She is extremely accessible though and a real treat. 3) If its Rosen TAKE IT. Lectures are gold and your notes, provided that you truly know how to take notes (actually a rare skill), you will excel. He's amazing.

Rosen is an engaging lecturer, and his no-computer and random-calling works to promote student engagement. Precept was used less to clarify or reinforce lecture material and more to teach new concepts, which often meant that each topic was covered for only minutes before students were meant to engage with it on the problem sets. Textbook reading is only useful for concept reinforcement, and syllabus non-textbook readings are worth only a skim before the final.

Rosen teaches it very well, and the amount of effort beyond lectures and precepts is minimal (problem sets and some reading). Keep in mind that Rosen is slightly partisan in his approaches to things, so do not be completely swayed by some of the problem sets and examples from class. It sometimes feels like Rosen is trying to make you believe that minimum wage is the worst thing that could happen, rent control hurts the gay community, the ACA was ridiculous, and welfare and subsidies are not justified.

Material in lecture and precept sometimes didn't match up (i.e. we only learned Isocost lines and Isoquant curves in Precept once and never went over it lecture). The problem sets were definitely necessary in order to understand topics covered in lecture since instruction was not always the most comprehensive or clear. Problem sets were not super difficult, but did require some thinking.

Not difficult - except Rosen's tests are much harder than any of the other professors.", "Harvey is a great and stimulating lecturer. He went over a lot of problems in class explaining various concepts.

I went to McGraw every week, had a great preceptor (Molly) and found a way to get to the final with a B.  I absolutely recommend that you at least read Mankiw and do so before the lectures if you can as it really helps understand the material.  You will be given past exams but take note that the midterm was a little tricky for some, although the answer is usually easier to find than you may think it is.  When answering the problem set or even other exam questions, I found it helpful to think of the answer that Professor Rosen would want it to be, meaning he leans right and so take that into consideration when finding the answers to the questions he made up (all of them).\nAlso, I think taking micro by Rosen is the best path for anyone who is not a math person or is taking it for WWS as the class is well-designed overall and both the professor and preceptors try to lay the material out in a way so that everyone understands regardless of their familiarity with economics.", "I would advise students to stay on top of the readings, do the problem sets early, and go to office hours.", "I would definitely recommend taking this course.

Personally, I'm not very good at/interested in Econ, but I still recommend the course in general. If you have to take Eco, try to take it when Rosen's teaching - he's a world-class leading economist, and a resource available to us here at Princeton.

Not an extremely difficult course - if you're not good at eco, attend all lectures (actually, if you're lucky enough to have Rosen, attend all lectures anyway). People who are really good at eco may not need to go to all of the lectures. I didn't do readings most weeks, which I regret, but I'm getting by ok. Christian Alonso was a great preceptor!

I had taken AP computer science and had some background in data structures, but still learned a ton from this course. The intro to programming was somewhat of a review, but the richness and extent of the programming curriculum far exceeded my high school experience. Learning theory and how computers actually work later in the course was also new. And extremely exciting! My major advice would be to make sure to get ahead on lecture videos.

It relies a lot more on problem solving and being clever/creative than 126 did, but the material is super rewarding to learn and the course is very well taught. Also, having Arvind as a lecturer and Maia as a preceptor really made the course beyond worthwhile for me.", "Please take this course on Coursera before you actually take it at Princeton.

I know I regret not learning this class on Coursera at my own pace first.", "Prepare to learn most, if not all of the material on your own. Algorithms is an important concept to understand and unfortunately, most of the learning will have to come from you. Expect very little in the ways of teaching from this class.", "Prereading before the class helps tremendously.  Lectures are more concept oriented, precepts are more skill oriented.  Exercises help you refine your skills while assignments help you learn to apply them. Tests are very comprehensive, covering both concept understanding and theory, actual skills like tracing algorithms, and even algorithm design, so spread out the learning and work throughout the semester.", "Really interesting course and very helpful for life", "Regular lecture is probably a better option; don't do flipped if Guna is heading it.

Seriously.  He is awesome: a great lecturer, and very accessible to students.", "The assignments are fun and easy to do and shouldn't take up too much time. I would spend a lot more time preparing for the exams because they are conceptually difficult. Past years' exams have been very standard and I did well when doing them as practice tests, but Arvind decided to make a new type of exam that was extremely difficult. Just keep that in mind when taking this class. If you ever get lost, I highly recommend watching the flipped lectures (these are available to all students) because Sedgewick does a great job at explaining the material.", "The assignments are very fun!", "The exercises are very helpful; don't neglect them.", "This class is pretty hard, but worth it. You learn a ton of interesting information. Hours per week isn't that bad either.", "This course is amazing and if you enjoyed COS 126 then you will love this course.", "This course is going to be a lot of time and work, especially if you are someone without a natural inclination for COS. The weekly exercises are helpful because they force you to learn the algorithms each week, but try to refresh them regularly so you have a deep understanding of them. There are a lot!", "This course is probably the most important COS class you'll take, mainly because most technical interviews address the material that is covered in 226. So, take this class seriously. There is A LOT of material, so keep up with it!", "This course was awesome. Arvind's an awesome lecturer and the assignments are challenging, but not unmanageable and generally really satisfying.", "This is a very time-consuming class and a hard class. I got A- from cos126 and now expecting B /A- on this course. There are so many interesting algorithms that you will learn in this class. You can do really well if you have time to read the book. The lecture is also very helpful. I recommend this class as a departmental elective for non-cos major.", "This was one of my favorite courses at Princeton so far, and I would highly recommend this class to anyone, not only COS majors. It teaches you how to problem solve and think creatively, and also gives you all the tools necessary to apply for jobs that ask algorithmic questions.", "Time consuming, but very rewarding. Super interesting and fun", "Took this course as a BSE considering COS (but ultimately deciding to stick with CBE) because I really enjoyed 126. Unfortunately, 226 is quite literally it's title: algorithms and data structures. The entire course is essentially a list of key data structures (albeit ones that build on each other) that, while very useful for getting you through interviews, are not the most engaging topics to fill an entire semester. I pity future generations, having to endure Guna and flipped lectures against their will. I chose to do so out of practicality and genuine desire, but realize that it is definitely not for everyone. Expect to spend more time on the assignments than in 126, but overall a doable course.", "Totally take this class. It opens your mind up to how to solve problems and thinking about solutions, at least in the discrete-math/cos world and in real-life.\nIt's also cool.\n\nFlipped lecture vs. normal lecture:\nI would say that if you are into working with other people through problems and have no problem with learning on your own by watching videos, then I would recommend it. Personally for me, 11:00 in the morning after running up to McCosh does not quite work for me (esp. when my previous class runs late and have assignments due at 10:00 in the morning), so looking back on it, I liked taking the flipped lecture. I also went to normal precept the first week and just answered questions and I was kinda bored for part of the time (even with coming late), so I would say that this was the best choice for me. If prof. Gunawardena is teaching the class then it may be a bit more bumpy then it need be, but I still think that the negatives are outweighted by the postives.\n\nI would recommend looking at the old exams to get a feel for the exams, since I feel that they do not change too much each year though they are technically different.\nI don't know if you need to buy the book. I hardly spent an hour in it, though I was in the flipped lecture so I could always refer to the videos/lecture slides/booksite.", "Very good course.", "Very interesting material, well taught, really fun assignments.", "Would recommend.

In addition, if you were not in Professor Schwartz's precept, then you never knew if what the preceptor said was actually what Professor Schwartz would say was correct, because there were several occasions where the preceptor said something that was later directly contradicted by the professor, or said something which was the right answer, but with unclear logic.\nWhat you learn about how to adjust reactivity and mechanisms for inorganic processes, though, could be incredibly valuable depending on what you are working on. Also, lectures are incredibly engaging!\nIf you take this, the final practice exams do not have answer keys, so take them early enough in reading week so that you can schedule appointments with Schwartz in order to go over questions you have.

If you're thinking about taking it: work on the problem sets alone, check with other people, but trust your intuition and know why YOU think a certain answer is right. This is the type of reasoning that is required on the exam. \nFor any Chem majors deciding between 407 or 408, 407 is more textbook-style, great for the fundamentals but stuff you'll probably never see in your research. 408 is less structured, more data driven, and stuff you'll hear about in your group meetings.", "Not a bad workload.

It was immensely difficult to determine who \"major theorists\" were, given that we discussed every reading except Thucydides (seriously, not everything has to be compared to Ancient Greece, and if I have to hear or read one more bozo who insists that Greek civilization ended after the Peloponnesian War...historically illiterate statements like that were a frequent occurrence in lecture) exactly once. That lack of in-depth analysis makes the comical volume of reading assigned (fewer than 200 pages A MEETING was light, and for one meeting we were assigned an entire 500 page book and another 100 pages of supplemental readings) all the more unconscionable. In short do not take this class, especially if you are interested in strategy or history.

Prof Zelizer is quite good facilitating discussion.", "I was not a fan of Prof. Zelizer's seminars. Another student had told me how wonderful his lectures were, and from seminar you can tell that lecturing is his strength. He talks a lot about history, especially in the early seminars, and infuses so many things with personal anecdotes. Unfortunately this leaves little opportunity for students to engage in discussion compared to a normal seminar course. I often had things I wanted to say but couldn't; a person actively trying to talk was afforded the opportunity maybe twice each seminar. As a result, there was little actual discussion; we wanted to share what we had been sitting on for five minutes rather than respond to the last student's point. I think discussions were not very productive for this reason. There was also not a feeling of connectedness and warmth, but Prof. Zelizer is not entirely to blame for that, as the room setup was really poor -- it's a very industrial room and for no reason at all the desks are arranged so that there is a large hole between them, which pushes people apart and makes everyone distant. I think Prof. Zelizer might have been fighting an uphill battle there. And although he couldn't connect with us and moderated discussion poorly, he secured some great guest speakers like Stephen Engelberg, editor in chief at ProPublica. The readings were interesting in isolation, but they did not form a coherent course. The reading load was heavy, usually a book a week, and we rarely talked about them in seminar. Therefore most students did not read most of the books. Overall I am grateful to Prof. Zelizer for the experience, the hard work he put into securing the speakers, and the lectures that gave us a good sense of the history of the country's media. I might, however, recommend a different journalism course. We did very little writing over the course of the semester so this course is not likely to help you become a better writer or journalist.", "If you are interested in the topic of media and policy this is a great course to take.", "If you have an interest in what the journalism industry looks like, definitely take this course.

There's not much discussion in Zelizer's iteration of the class.  It's also an easy class to skate by in, if that's what you're looking for.

This course is what you make of it, but there's something for everyone!", "DEFINITELY take CWR with AM Homes! She's chill, sarcastic, funny, and very smart.", "Darcey is a really understanding professor. If you want a chill new-to-creative-writing course, take it with her. If you've had creative writing in the past and want something more intensive maybe look elsewhere.", "Definitely consider taking this course. It is a good amount of work but is quite fun and rewarding. It's also really cool to see not just what you end up writing but what others end up writing as well.", "Definitely take intro to short fiction if you want a chill class with a small group of students that will be both fun and informative. Definitely opened my eyes to the technical and craft considerations that go into good creative writing.", "Definitely take it! The assignments are fun and the class workshop sessions are very helpful.", "Don't procrastinate on the papers.", "Don't write at the last minute, because there's no point getting your mediocre work showed to and critiqued by the class.", "Fiona Maazel is a wonderful professor who has a lot to teach you, and I definitely gained a lot from this class! Take it with her :)", "Fiona is cool and a good teacher. Take creative writing!", "Fiona is very particular. Very \"by her book\". Her teaching style can be stifling. When analyzing readings, she frames everything so that there is a correct answer, which is her answer. She got better (less like this) as the semester progressed. Her critiques on full stories were good, but the exercises sometimes felt pointless because she would not read them and give feedback, or we would not all be able to share during class time. Overall, I really like how the class was structured in terms of each week being themed (openings, endings, line editing, etc.) I learned a lot lot. If Fiona were more friendly/open/less rigid/different, the class would be A1", "For sure take it if you love to write.", "Fun class. Low work. Sigrid Nunez is great!", "Good class if you truly like creative writing.", "Great class to take to learn a new perspective - even if you're an engineer.", "I absolutely loved Professor Homes' class. Everyone participates since she always goes around the table to ask about people's responses to each reading/workshop paper, but I feel like she would let us pass as well if we wanted to. I'd also imagine that creative writing also largely depends on your classmates, and I happened to be with a batch of students that seemed actually interested in creative writing rather than simply BSing it as a PDF class. We started out by doing some shorter writings in class and readings for homework, and Prof Homes eased us into short stories for homework after we'd done a little in-class writing. It made me feel a let more confident about my writing when my first long workshop story was due after I'd had some practice before--I think most of my friends in different creative writing classes had their first workshop stories due much before the first of our classes'. Prof Homes is also just a really interesting and chill person, and she's very receptive about possible changes and student opinions.", "I definitely think you should take a CWR class before graduating. It's such an awesome change of pace, and the P/D/F makes sure its not too demanding. Writing short stories can be very time consuming, and you write a lot of them, but it's such a fun break from the other kind of work classes usually have you do. Also A.M. is amazing. She's really kind, REALLY experienced, really awesome, and really helpful. Definitely recommend her class.", "I highly recommend taking this course! If you have the chance, think about what you would want to write for your stories in order to avoid writing a 10-20 page story the night before it's due.", "I like CWR, which is why I'll still recommend even despite one bad experience. Just find a good teacher?ask around?read the reviews. Hanna's a wonderful person but her class is a bit . . . lacking.", "I think a class with White is better for people pursuing creative writing over several classes than those with just a general interest/taking it for an LA.", "I would highly recommend both creative writing and taking with Darcey because it was a great course and introduction to creative writing.", "If you are at all interested in writing fiction, I'd highly recommend this course! Not only was it a lot of fun, but I feel like my writing skills also improved over the course of the semester.", "If you have ever thought about writing or ever wanted to try, take the course. It's extremely open and dynamic, letting you try out whatever you want.", "If you're at all interested in Fiction, be it reading or writing, take the course! You can't go wrong - it can be very little work if it doesn't thrill you, but for me it made me read and write completely differently.", "It took me a little while to warm up to her, but Fiona is great if you want a more structured class with more concrete writing lessons", "It's a great class to take and will help you as a writer if you take it seriously and put in the effort. What you put in is what you get out for sure!", "It's a great pdf only class if you have a hard semester.", "One of the best classes at Princeton! Professor Homes is truly extraordinary, and you'll see your writing improve so much while enjoying a laid back and encouraging atmosphere. It's just a lot of fun!", "Participate in the discussion and don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone!", "Please only take this if you want to become a better writer--there are already too many people taking it for an \"easy\" LA, and they usually make the classes miserable.", "Professor Nunez is great! The workload is low, but the class is very rewarding.", "Really put effort into creative writing because you will improve as a writer and you'll have fun doing it!", "Relatively light work load and lots of fun.", "TAKE THIS CLASS. Darcey is absolutely amazing and interesting. She has so many funny and sincere suggestions to improve your writing. She also exposes you to many different styles and modes through the readings so she really does give you tools to craft beautiful prose. The workshops were very helpful (this is coming from someone who loves horror/sci fi/fantasy, while Darcey writes very different stuff).", "Take a Creative Writing Course!!! They are very fun and worthwhile. Sigrid made every class interesting and was very helpful in her comments. One thing I would think about is that her classes are strutted differently than most. You have two large stories instead of small ones leading up to a large one. It was fun to be able to write a 10-20 page piece of fiction, but I didn't feel that my writing improved as much as it could have. I think she'd be a great teacher for a second CWR course, but a bit challenging for someones first experience with fiction.", "Take a creative writing class! It's great.", "Take it", "Take it if you like writing", "Take it, it's easy, fun, and teaches you how to do creative writing the right way.", "Take it...why not?", "Take the class. Why not? It's fun.", "Take the stories seriously and try your best to write something you would want to read. Criticism is hard to take but its ultimately very helpful!!!", "Take this class, and take it with AM Homes.", "Take this course if you're genuinely interested in creative writing! Don't take it if you want an easy PDF, because it's a waste of everyone's time.", "Take this course.", "The class is a little less structured than other CWR classes, but Prof. White is a really lovely person with some very interesting stories to tell.  His critiques are helpful without being harsh, which I appreciated.", "The course is a nice introduction to fiction writing. You really learn a lot about how to improve your writing style and I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in creative writing.", "This class was incredible! Professor White is funny and very encouraging, and I learned so much. The class was fun and engaging, and I was always looking forward to it. My skills as a writer have improved vastly.", "This course is highly enjoyable but may not hugely benefit your writing, especially if you already have a strong sense of your identity as a writer.", "This course was really fun in that you could write about whatever without the pressure of a grade. You should definitely take a CWR class at Princeton!", "This is a great class that is chill but also full of lots of fun reading and writing. It is very much a class where you will get out what you put in. Professor Steinke is great!", "This was one of my favorite courses in my four years at Princeton, and I wish I had taken it earlier. I highly recommend this course for students of all backgrounds. It's fun to write stories and read those of your classmates, and it's a nice change of pace from other courses.", "Very good and engaging course.

The assignments are challenging, but you will receive a lot of help from the course staff.", "Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the material, so I didn't enjoy the class a whole lot. However, I can recognize that it's well-taught for what it is. If you think you might be interested in big data analysis, go ahead and take this course. Don't kill yourself trying to answer every question perfectly.", "I recommend this course to anyone who is seeking a bit of a challenge. It is a tough course, but a very rewarding learning experience. Also there is an amazing amount of love and effort put into this course from both the TA and Han Liu resulting in well refined lectures and assignments. You will probably not find a higher quality course in machine learning/statistics.", "I'm an ORFE major and I still learned so much in this class. You gain a mathematical intuition for broad concepts like Bayesian statistics, regression, and clustering that you took for granted in other classes. However, the TAs were overloaded this year and gave us assignments back way too late.", "I'm glad I took this class because it taught me some new data science concepts and will look good on my resume (I am trying to go into the data science field), but good god do the instructors not make it easy. The problem sets will consume your entire life, and the TA's seem to take sadistic pleasure in you complaining about them, sending disrespectful gifs of cartoon characters crying. Our last problem set was our longest and was due just a couple days after our midterm (normally we get a week). Problem sets take at least 10 dedicated hours - MUCH longer if you're not good at theory. The TA's don't seem to know the material well, so you'll have to rely on finding other people in the class to supplement the areas you're not great at. You'll code some cool models, but be warned that this class is the most time intensive one I've taken as an ORFE major.", "If you have ANY interesting in statistics and data science, you MUST take this course.", "If you have the time, please take this course! You won't regret it. Learned so much and inspired my thesis topic.", "It definitely can be a challenging course, and the problem sets will generally take a very long time to complete. That said, the material is very interesting, and the instructors work hard to accommodate the students. If you take this class, be prepared to spend a lot of time on the homeworks, and also work in groups and check Piazza a lot.", "It's a good course for non-ORF majors (like me), though my ORF friends said it covered a lot of material they'd already seen in previous classes. The instructors care a lot. They're very active on Piazza. The workload was very high this year, but I think they're going to get a lot of feedback about that and make significant changes to the course for next year.", "It's a lot of work!", "It's a lot of work. More than ORF 309. But you learn a ton and it's invaluable if you want to work in a data-analytic field.", "Learn great material, however the organization of the course this semester was very poor. Constant corrections made to HW near the deadlines, and \"undergraduate course designer\" was unnecessarily sassy on Piazza to students genuinely seeking help.

Plan ahead, start hw early and go to office hours.\nBe prepared to be constantly flooded by Piazza posts.", "Take this course if you want to learn about big data statistics and applications of statistics.  It is a little bit a work, but well worth it.", "Take this course, take it! It teaches you so much about data analysis. Han Liu is one of the best and most caring lecturers out there; while the homeworks may be tedious and the class very fast-paced, I learned a lot and it's one of the most valuable courses I've taken here at Princeton so far.", "The best class at Princeton I've taken, and I've taken a lot of quantitative classes. Compared to COS AI, it's a much more unifying perspective on Big Data: focusing on fewer topics while tying a lot of methods together with a common theme, unlike in AI where the topics are often scattered and barely adequately addressed. The participation assignment (10 minutes of writing out important points in the most recent lecture) was actually really helpful - often at Princeton I don't have time to look over the most recent lecture, which is a bad habit.", "This class has interesting material but spends a lot of time on some concepts to the point of getting repetitive. Han Liu is really determined to make sure every student understands the ins and outs of what he teaches, which probably means you'll come away from this class with a good understanding of the concepts but also have spent a lot more time than you wanted to on assignments and lectures that test and repeat what you already understand.", "This class is so effing hard. That being said, you learn so much. I think that it's certainly worth taking, but just be prepared to spend a lot of time!", "This class is very interesting, but it is extremely time consuming.  Would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about machine learning and big data analysis, but just be aware that this class will take up a big chunk of your time.", "This course had exceptional reviews last year. I and many others were very excited to take it this year, but we found a couple surprises: Prof. Liu's lecturing style is good and very organized, but was irradically paced. The course was also very full, and the weekly assignments were very long and didn't feel like they went with the lectures very well. Nevertheless, as the course continued, I did feel myself learning a lot about ML and statistics, and at the end of the lecture I can see how everything was organized. I highly recommend this class to everyone interested in ML. It provides a solid understanding of the basic concepts, but don't expect to learn much about the exciting concepts like NN and what not. This class isn't about applications.", "This course was a rare gem. Not only did I learn and gain a deep understanding of concepts taught, I also immensely enjoyed the material because of the way in which it was presented and taught. The course is very well paced and reasonable. Han Liu and his team are amazing. One of the best courses I've taken at Princeton!", "This is a great class in terms of content, teaching, and focus on the students' learning outcomes. Do not take if you are not willing to learn or work hard.", "This is the best course that I have taken in the ORFE department and I would highly recommend this course.", "This was a relatively chill class (weekly problem set, exams very lowly weighted) given how well I feel I learned the material.", "Towards the end, the problem sets were unrealistically long (e.g., I would work for 20  hours on them and still not finish). But the teaching staff was very responsive on Piazza and in office hours, and Professor Liu even canceled one of the final problem sets to make it easier on the class near thesis and JP deadlines. Overall, I really learned a lot and would recommend this class, just be sure you're able to devote the necessary amount of work.", "Wonderful class to take. The workload was very tough to handle, though, especially as a senior. Problem sets were also not returned in a timely manner at all. However, this is largely due to the fact that the course was understaffed given a large amount of students. Overall, it was worth the effort to learn such useful and interesting material.", "You need a math background to get a lot out of this class. \nI'm hoping the curve is generous!!!", "You will definitely learn a lot, but it will also take up a LOT of your time.  This is definitely one of the best classes in terms of how much and how well I learned a specific topic, but it will be your hardest/most time consuming course.", "han liu is the best ORFE professor out there. his class is phenomenal and he absolutely enjoys teaching. you will learn a lot, and it will take a lot of time, but it is definitely worth it if you have the time to spare. don't take during a heavy semester."], "area": "QR", "ratings": {"Overall Quality of the Course": 4.45, "Lectures": 4.69, "Papers, Reports, Problem Sets, Examinations": 4.06, "Feedback for other students": 4.47, "Readings": 4.26}, "prereqs": "ORF 245.", "descrip": "The amount of data in our world has been exploding, and analyzing large data sets is becoming a central problem in our society.

Try to get Prof. Petta, Dr. Skoge, or Pufu as your preceptor. Labs in the first half of the semester were kinda meh, labs in the second half of the semester were pretty great. The exams were much easier than they could have been, and I thought the concepts they tested were relevant and fairly marked. Don't sign up for a 9am precept unless you will actually get up for it xD, and don't miss precept because that's your main opportunity to work out problems and ask questions.\n104 has been a good class, but in my case that positive experience was supplemented by some of the 106 lectures and by having lots of friends who love physics.

I really liked my preceptor -- Monica Skoge, I found that she was really great at explaining the material!", "Problem sets and labs are your chance to boost your grade.", "Prof. Petta is the best! If you can, I highly recommend getting into his precept. He makes an effort to learn the names of all students and explains all concepts.

Like any other course, you get out what you put in.", "The course material covers a lot and can be a bit overwhelming. On the bright side, the labs are a lot less tedious than the old 103 labs (goodbye, 3 hours of calculating uncertainties)", "The quizzes and exams are very fair so my main advice is to simply go to lecture, do the readings, do the psets, and spend time doing the Friday packets and past exams so you are adequately prepared. If you have any questions the preceptors are great at answering them. I think this is a great STL if you are more of a mathy person.", "The staff for this course is fantastic; I had Monica Skoge as a preceptor and she tries her heart out to make sure you do as well as possible in the course. The actual material is about as boring as it gets. I don't think any reviews on here should sway you toward taking/not taking the class, considering it is an intro BSE requirement course, but know that the staff makes such a course as good as possible, whether or not you like the material.", "They made this course so much better from what I heard the previous year! I happened to enjoy the material much more than mechanics and Professor PEtta did a great job with lectures. They made the exams more fair and quizzes as well. So, yes, its still a tough course but it's not as bad to go through so don't worry. Just make sure to ask for a lot of help if you need it.", "This class has improved from how it was perceived to be in previous years - that being said, I would still only take the class if it is required.", "This class is definitely not as hard as people say it is. The first couple of week are tough but if you work hard then you will do well", "This class is much better than 103, but it is still a freshman engineering requirement", "This class is not terribly difficult, but be prepared to teach yourself a lot.", "This course is an interesting one if you are interested in physics, especially the lectures.", "This course is far more engaging and reasonably structured than PHY 103. Professor Petta does a fantastic job in lecture (and if you can get into his precept, DEFINITELY do!!), and the labs offered far more opportunities to explore physics like actual scientists would. If you have any interest in physics at all, TAKE THIS COURSE!!! It's not easy, but it's doable and highly rewarding.", "This course is not a huge amount of work, but do make sure you learn the concepts each week because they come back often.", "This course is pretty well taught. Prof Petta really wants you to like the course, and that comes across pretty clearly, but unfortunately the material is just boring. You definitely want Prof Ong as your preceptor -he is excellent. Its not that difficult, but after a while you just won't care anymore, and if you haven't seen the material before in another class/high school, your grade will drop rapidly. Overall, well-taught, but not even the best doctor can revive a dead horse. Sorry.", "This course may challenge you at times, but it is also remarkable how much you can learn and retain after just a few short months. Come in ready to work, and you will be rewarded.", "This is a good course if you like physics.  I wouldn't take it if you are on the fence of whether or not you like physics.  Still, if you want to go down a physics track or feel confident you'll do well, I think this is a good course to take.", "This is a great course! Petta is fantastic! Make sure you attend precepts and have detailed notes. The concepts build and if you can't keep up you'll fall behind, hard. Do psets early, like one week ahead. This will help.", "This is a great course. The material is presented in a very clear way. Take Professor Waseem Bakr's precept if you can. He is the best preceptor.", "This is a pretty good class overall, though the labs are sometimes just confirming what you already know is going to happen. The lectures are pretty cool as Professor Petta does awesome demos basically every week, as well as giving a decent review of the material. I wouldn't necessarily take notes during lecture, as you're going to be reviewing the same things in precept, though that's up to you. Be careful with doing the online homework because losing points for things like misreading units or sign errors is really irritating. Study for the quizzes; each week it may feel like you lost just a couple points, but by the end of the semester it can really add up. Try to get a good preceptor (maybe shop around a bit). I had Professor Gregor, who I thought did a really good job (though he will call on you regardless of whether you have your hand up, so be ready).", "This is not a great course, especially if you are not interested in E&M, but if you have to take it, you have to take it.", "Try and read ahead, it will pay dividends.", "Try to get Professor Petta for your preceptor! He is amazing. Also, do the Friday packets and go to Mcgraw to be prepared for the quizzes.", "Try to read the textbook every week or at least skim it. Don't skip precept, it's not worth it.", "Try to study some electricity and magnetism beforehand, so you will be more comfortable with the material.", "Use MIT's OpenCourseWare materials -- they frequently explain the material more clearly that the textbook or the lectures, and the only topic that 104 covers that i've seen the MIT lecture notes not cover is thin film interference.", "Utilize office hours and McGraw study rooms for help. Understand how to do the psets and Friday packets and you should be fine.", "Very good class. Try to get into Petta's precept!", "Very manageable class if you stay on top of material and study for weekly quizzes.

If you truly are interested in physics, take PHY106 instead.", "Will most likely take as a distribution requirement for BSE. The material and difficulty are comparable to PHY 103 so if you did well there you will find similar success in this course.", "Would only recommend this course to non-BSE students if they were truly interested in learning more about physics. Content I found difficult, so wouldn't readily recommend to people not very willing to jump in and learn to derive physics formulae, etc.", "Would only take if required.", "Would probably not recommend to those who don't need to take it, but for requirements it's a good course", "Yes, take this course if you are even remotely interested in physics.  While sometimes the math may be a bit challenging, if you put in a little extra effort, you'll understand everything!", "You gotta take it, right? I heard you may want to take 106 just because it is better taught, but 104 is generally okay. Get a good lab TA, it'll make it way less miserable.

The lecturers are all wonderful and very willing to help, as were my preceptor and lab TA (Bruce and Xinlei). Make sure to leave time before each exam to review all of the lectures. There's a lot of material and a lot of memorization, but the key to a lot of the short-answer exam questions is understanding why certain things happen the way they do. Labs are pretty low stress and you get to leave early in some of them (so not as terrible as orgo lab), but this is still a lab course and the longer lab reports take a while to write well.", "This is a pretty cool class. If you are looking at it for an STL or for general interest i would recommend it as long as you can handle the 8:30 time. The lectures are interesting and the only work is the lab reports which don't take too long. The exams aren't too bad, you just have to put some effort into memorizing.  Overall its a good course.", "This is a pretty easy course - don't hesitate to take it as a fifth class or to get it out of the way early for science majors, pre-meds, etc. Gavis is an absolutely brilliant lecturer, too - I never missed one. The class does a great job of covering everything from chemical aspects of biology to genetics and makes great cultural connections; a good class to take for general interest or to satisfy an STL as well.", "This is a really good intro to molecular bio class, just be sure to keep up with your notes because it starts to become a lot to memorize and understand. But the later topics are very cool (epigenetic, cancer, CRISPR-Cas) Professor Notterman and Professor Gavis make the lecture very interesting.", "Try to review the lecture material on a weekly basis because if you wait until the exams to review everything, it feels like a lot of content that you suddenly must memorize.

Very do-able class if you go to lecture and study hard", "Very manageable class if you've taken high school bio, especially if you found it intuitive then!  There is memorization involved but as long as you don't leave studying to the last moment you'll be fine!", "Very well organized course. It really is AP Bio, and I tripped myself up a bit when I wanted to talk about the chemistry of why everything was happening. Don't do that - the course is very wide in breadth, but we never talk about the chemistry behind any of the biology, and it's all very memory-intensive and hand-wavey.

One of my last pre-med classes and the hardest so far.", "Well organized and well-taught course. Perhaps lots of premeds so average exam grades high but great class.

The questions raised by the course are certainly interesting, Rosen's lectures are great (he explains texts and ideas perhaps even a bit /too/ well), and he chose a wide variety of texts. However, I think as the semester progressed, I became increasingly disillusioned with myself for worrying about, say, the continuity of personal identity, or how best to construct an argument attempting to refute the brain-in-the-vat hypothesis, when millions of children are dying because they don't have access to clean drinking water or their families can't put enough food on the table or climate change/severe environmental conditions have afflicted their homes.

Even if you don't think poetry is up your ally, it's a great class.", "Did not receive a single positive comment from Monica Youn all semester on my poem.

All of them speak to the question of \"how does poetry make life more bearable, and worth living?\" which revolutionized how I thought about and approached my work. You get out what you put in. And with such an inspiring professor, it's hard not to be inspired/to write a well-developed poem each week. An unforgettable course.", "Take this class (I wish I had taken it more than once during my time at Princeton)!

Stone's section is reportedly harder and takes a lot of time but is more engaging and you learn a lot of out of it and he has support for struggling students. So if you identify learning as a spiritual experience, then maybe his class is better for you. But Yannis' class is designed for people who stick by the book, are in it to build a basic foundation, and are for people who need to just either need credit or \"need to know diff eq\". That might make it seem like Yannis' class is bad, but that would be hugely disrespectful to what his course offers and to Yannis himself. Yes, the teaching could be better, but this is something Yannis consciously acknowledges that he has a lot of improve on and puts in the effort to do so. He cares a lot. The book is actually great and readable, and makes a good complement to the course. The preceptors and Yannis put in a great deal in having office hours, being responsive to emails, and caring. And the fact that this course is designed to teach \"practical diff eq\" does not mean that you will learn nothing, and in fact I would say I learned quite a lot. The course is deliberately taught this way. So having said all of this, I was very satisfied actually by what the course offered even if at times it wasn't thrilling. But it is up to you to decide which is best for you and figure out what you want for yourself, and which learning style is \"easy\" or \"hard\". \"Wait. but how can make those comparisons when you never took Stone's section\" well yes, that is true and I will leave your evaluations of such biases yourself.", "This class was reasonable and the entire teaching staff really made the time to help you if you reached out.  Precepts were especially helpful in learning the material practically and I would recommend them even though they weren't mandatory.", "This course is far easier than it is in the spring, but you will not walk away with a solid understanding of the material.

While you do in some instances get to see cool applications of things you have learned in your other core courses, the labs themselves are not particularly interesting or useful. That being said, this course builds some very useful and fundamental skills in oral presentation, data analysis, data presentation, and technical report writing. Choose a partner you don't mind spending a lot of time working together with. Working style compatibility is probably more important, but if you have a good friend that satisfies that requirement, you will enjoy this experience more because you'll be able to sit there and make jokes even while scrambling to finish at 3 am the day of your presentation.", "Core lab is great.

I?m sorry. Just try (somehow) to get the professors to like you early in the course, and you?ll probably survive. Do data analysis as you go, and spend a lot of time practicing your oral presentation and predicting what questions you?ll be asked so you can prepare responses to them.\n\nIf you?re a freshman or sophomore in CBE or considering CBE, don?t major in CBE. If you?re interested in environmental and sustainability things, do CEE. If you?re interested in the more physical engineering aspects of the major, do MAE. If you like chemistry, there?s no chemistry in this major?do Chem. If you?re pre-med or interested in bio things, do MOL. If you?re interested in the quantitative problem-solving aspects, do COS. There?s literally no reason to do this major. You got through CBE 245, which was easy but boring, and thought the difficulty level would stay the same while getting to more interesting topics, so you stuck with CBE. Then you took thermo, which was really hard, but you survived it so you assumed you were through the worst. Then you take separations, which is a lot of memorization but is reasonable, so you think things are looking up. You take transport, and it?s really hard but you think you?ve come far enough now that you may as well stick with it. You?ve heard core lab is awful, but you?re ?good at lab things? so you think you?ll be fine. You won?t. This course doesn?t test your lab skills or your analysis skills, but rather how good you are at sucking up to professors and making them like you. It tests how good your karma is, because which labs you?re assigned and which professors are grading them is the most important thing in determining your grade. Switch majors, not just for this class (although this is an awful class), but because nothing about this major is worth it.\n\nIf you?re an administrator, believe me when I say this course needs a hard look. This is, by far, the worst class I?ve been put through at Princeton. I got nothing out of it, because the only skills it purports to teach (writing lab reports, giving presentations) were skills I already had. Instead, I spent a whole semester working as hard as anyone to please professors who seem to decide randomly which students to like and help, and which students to make fun of and give D grades to. I know this class is supposed to be hard, and I?m fine with that, as long is students are given adequate help and the grades that they earn, which is not how this class is run. Professors Koel and Prud?homme at least try to be helpful and fair?while they do grade harshly, that?s fine as long as it?s done equally to everyone, which it seems to be. I am amazed, however, that professor Benziger is allowed to teach courses at Princeton. He randomly picks a about 4 students to like and help and give unreasonably high grades to. Everyone else he gives horrible grades with no explanation, asks absurdly hard questions, unreasonable questions in oral presentations. There is no way that a well-performed, well-analyzed, and well-explained lab report should get a score in the low 60s, which happened to several friends of mine. There?s no way that physical questions that the TAs don?t know the answers to should be asked in oral presentations. I?m sure he is very knowledgable, but that doesn?t matter if he refuses to help any of us or actually teach us anything. I got absolutely nothing out of this course except frustration with this department for allowing this class to continue as it seems to have been for years without making any attempt to make it less awful.", "Ignore the professors, just get help from the TAs.", "Keep on top of data analysis, really do try and do it before the next lab in case you find errors.", "Lol its CBE core lab.", "Not as rough as expected, but still a rough ride nonetheless", "Professors: Koel is strict, but somewhat fair.

Flatter him, and he'll help you. Ask him for help because otherwise, he'll tank you and your grade by asking you graduate-level questions far beyond your capacity. Gives absolutely useless advice and it's ironic how in his presentations, he often does the very things he says not to.\nLabs: Some are easy, some are hard. The hard ones are anything to do with dimensionless quantities (like heat transfer, polymer extrusion, fluidized beds). Easy ones include enzyme kinetics, control schemes (not level nor mixing but temp control), distillation, etc. It's unfair that some people will get 4 easy labs, and some people will get 4 hard labs, but sucks to suck. Try to put the minimum work on reports and posters and oral presentations since the grading is a crapshoot. Honestly, the 3 professors will collaborate to determine your oral presentation grade, which means that a professor who thinks you deserve a 95 will cross that 95 out and give you an 85 if the other 2 profs feel that way. It's a shit system.\nWritten report: You do not have to complete every point mentioned in the handout. Rather, pick a few to focus on and tie together .The other ones, complete (with minimal effort) in the appendices. Talk to your grading professor about what to focus on and what they would like to see. Expectations vary across the 3.\nOral report: Speak LOUDLY, make eye contact, and practice. 50% of your grade is based on how well you exude confidence and dominate that room. Make sure your PPT slides are spotless, because you don't want to give the profs any extra ammo for criticizing you. 50% of your grade is on your data.

Another complaint, which is not the fault of the class, was that crypto is very repetitive.

A lot of time is just time is just playing scavenger hunt on stack overflow.\n(2) Mind-reading. Assignments are usually poorly written. In one assignment, there were comments in the provided code that contradicts what the instructions said. When someone asked him on piazza, he said something like, \"oh, the comments are a rough guide only\".

His lectures are a different story, usually extremely disorganized. He will say he would cover 3 topics today, but he will spend almost 50 minutes on the first topic, realise he is out of time, then speed through the next two topics faster than a ping to Google.com.
