The lectures and topics I enjoyed most were those relating to metaethics rather than applied ethics, and Michael Smith's \"Intro to Moral Philosophy\" is obviously the class to take on that subject. I also found it frustrating that precepts never focused on philosophy or argument analysis. Instead, students were ever more prone to talk about their opinions than in other philosophy classes, since these issues are often controversial. I would recommend this course, since Singer is truly brilliant, but I do have some reservations.", "I would advise everyone to take this course if they want to learn about philosophy from an applicable perspective, and start thinking critically about everyday issues like animal rights, abortion, and ethical career choices.", "I would advise to take the course if you have any interest in the subject at all.", "I would consider PDFing if you are taking the course for the distribution requirement because there is a huge difference between the amount of effort needed to get an A (mainly preparation for the final) and to get a 'passing' grade.\n\nThis class is important though for forming your opinion on critical ethical issues & is a great way to get informed if you have never considered your views on abortion/vegetarianism/euthanasia before.  Also a great experience from the writing perspective if you are in the humanities and have never written such formal/hierarchical papers.  A great exercise.", "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a good way to take care of an EM requirement while also experiencing the lectures of a leading philosopher and engaging with complex and interesting material.", "I would recommend this course, with the caveat that the first half of semester (sanctity of life issues) gets a bit dull and repetitive, but the second half is great and really thought-provoking.", "I would suggest actually purchasing the book Elements of Moral Philosophy, as it provided a useful supplement to the course.", "I would take this course, but don't expect the lectures to be thrilling; Singer is a better writer than speaker.", "I would tell them to take it.", "I'd say take it, but don't feel bad if you miss lecture. Go in with an open mind and you'll get a lot out of it.", "I'm glad I took this course. The material is interesting, and the course teaches you to think differently about topics on which you might take for granted your opinion. I would recommend the course, but pray that your preceptors are different from the ones this semester! And take everything Singer says at face value. His views are super controversial, but he's actually very nice.", "I'm really not a \"humanities\" person, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this course. The subject matter is quite interesting. Writing the papers was fun--it's rewarding to try to think up creative but logical arguments, present them clearly and explicitly, and defend them. Get Rob (James Hunter) for your preceptor--he makes precepts interesting and quite worth it.", "If you have an open mind and any interest in learning about analyzing moral issues such as abortion, climate change, etc., in rational terms, this is a great place to start.", "If you have never taken a philosophy course before, CHV 310 is a great place to start.  The topics are relevant to society and Professor Singer is a great lecturer.", "If you like ethics, then this course is a great introduction. It's a lot of work, but you'll come away with a great understanding of what makes a good ethical argument, and what the prominent positions are on different topics.", "If you need a good EM that isn't too demanding, Practical Ethics is a great choice. There is quite a bit of reading depending on the week, but often it is interesting and relevant.", "If you need an EM, this is the class for you.  However, this class isn't very rigorous as far a philosophy classes go, so if you want to learn about normative ethics, take a different class.", "Interesting class if you haven't had any exposure to utilitarianism. Less interesting if you already know what Peter Singer is going to say before he says it.", "It is a challenging but very interesting class", "It is a lot of work but it is a very interesting class and a lot of the issues pertain to everyday life.  I think that everyone should take it!!!", "It's a good, realatively easy course, and it provides a broad foundation for practical ethical issues.", "It's a very good PDF class: it's not hard to get a passing grade, and almost all of the lectures are interesting.", "It's an okay class for an EM.

Few academic experiences are as transformative as this one and I have Professor Singer to thank for making me a better person.", "Pretty chill class. Good for a PDF or 5th class as an engineer. Material is also in general interesting and relevant.", "Pretty interesting class and rather applicable to what you read about in the news/real world. I PDF-ed the class, but found that it wasn't necessarily one of the \"easiest\" PDF classes. This is because there's a lot of writing that goes into it, with two papers and a written final exam. If the exam had been multiple choice and one hour, like Abnormal Psychology, it would have been an awesome PDF. Aside from that, though, I feel like I did learn a bunch about relevant issues.", "Probably the best ethics course you're likely to find. Good for PDF.", "Professor Singer is great....awesome class to PDF!", "Read the material.", "Really interesting class. Definitely take it, not a lot of work at all, and preparing for precept is interesting so it doesn't seem like work.

I liked the reasoned-based course more than the lecture I sat in on for Christian Ethics. Also, I have been debating my religious affiliation lately, so studying a more \"practical\" forms of ethics appealed to me. Also, I heard Peter Singer was awesome. He was. \n\nProfessor Singer is really likeable. He teaches a casual lecture with pictures and easy-to-read text. His class is pretty straight forward. He could have done a better job presenting the other sides' views, but I really enjoyed hearing his perspective on a range of issues. He was always open to questions at the end and was very kind. I did not feel intimidated by him and felt comfortable asking any questions. He contributed greatly to my thoughts on controversial issues such as euthanasia and environmental issues. \n\nThe preceptors were very helpful in providing guidance on writing both papers.", "Take it! Keep an open mind and you may be convinced to actually change what you do from day to day. He might actually make you a better person.", "Take it! The reading load is manageable and the paper topics are interesting. Make sure to meet with your preceptor if these are the first philosophy papers you are writing-- it might be helful.", "Take it! This class will teach you how to think about ethical issues critically and often influences people in a direct way. My three roommates and I all became vegetarians after taking this course!", "Take it! really interesting.", "Take it, and try to be open-minded. I feel like it's a tragedy that people realize that Singer is right about things like animal welfare and global poverty but don't change their lifestyles because they can't be bothered. This course is a great opportunity to re-assess your lifestyle.", "Take it, but feel free to pdf it and not really have to do the readings.", "Take it.", "Take it. Ask questions. All the questions that you think about. Professor Singer is not only a great thinker, he makes you feel like one, too. He listens to questions, considers them, discusses them one on one.

It's really interesting, makes you think, and will help you become more educated on a wide range of pressing topics.", "Take this course before you graduate!!", "Take this course! But keep an open mind, there will be some mind-bending discussions.", "Take this course.", "Take this course. It is the most stimulating course at Princeton.", "Take this with Peter Singer and make sure to do the reading every week, not because it isn't hard to catch up at the end, but because you'll be able to develop your own convictions much more easily if you have read the material and can respond to it during the appropriate lectures. Taking this course will open your mind.", "Take this.", "Take this. Singer's not a perfect lecturer by any means, but it's interesting, not too hard, not too time consuming, and certainly worth the experience. That said, make sure to turn off the wi-fi during lectures.", "The course is interesting and worth taking.", "The perfect course with an interesting and slightly controversial professor, no work and learning a broad range of new ideas.", "Think of points you want to speak about and questions you want to open to discussion before precept.", "This course covers more relevant, diverse topics than many courses, and I would highly recommend taking this course.  Be sure to do the readings as the semester goes along, though, since they can really pile up if you wait until the end.", "This course is a great way to fulfill the EM requirement and perfect if you are looking for an interesting and thought-provoking class with a small workload. Prof. Singer is an engaging lecturer and the class covers a lot of relevant topics to everyday life. Even if you've never taken an ethics class before, take it!", "This course is excellent, and Professor Singer is endlessly kind. The workload is not high, the readings are readily consumable, and it will teach you how to reason ethically.", "This course is full of non-philosophy majors, which could be a good or bad thing. Many people PDF, so precepts can be slow at times. Otherwise a good introduction to ethics.", "This course is good to satisfy the EM distribution requirement. It is a very large class, and it is often very easy to fall behind on readings, however.", "This is a fun class if you are interested in applied ethics. The workload is very manageable and the readings are not hard to understand. Just make sure you have a good preceptor so you have plenty of opportunities for discussion", "This is a good PDF class. It will broaden your horizons but not take over your life. Do the reading since it's interesting and makes leacture very straightforward. Try to talk to your preceptor about you papers- they are very helpful.", "This is a great Philosophy course! It opens your eyes to real world ethical issues that you are someday bound to face. Though you might not agree with Peter Singer's views, you will appreciate what an impressive philosopher he is.", "This is a great course and will give you a new perspective into how you approach your everyday actions", "This is a great introductory course to more practical philosophy.  Yes, it is true that it does not focus as much on deductive logic of hardcore philosophy and is more dedicated to intuition, but it relates to topics that are pertinent to peoples' everyday lives and presents views on them that people may not have considered before, so I think it's definitely worth taking.", "This is a unique opportunity to think about practical ethics.", "This is great to PDF for an EM, you get a lot of knowledge on important issues and have to put in minimal effort/do no readings to pull of a B/C. I don't do any work for this class, just go to most of the lectures (and all the precepts). Wrote the first paper a few hours before it was due and got a B, so I don't expect too much trouble on the second paper and final exam", "This was a pretty good class!

If you're looking for a  more basic understanding, I imagine another professor may be a better choice.", "The course is very helpful in understanding the basics of economics.", "The course isn't horrible, but don't take it on general interest, you will find yourself bored.  Taking it for Econ isn't bad, but nothing great either, passive.", "The course says calc is not a prerec. YOU DO NEED CALC for full credit on problem set. Farber and Preceptors expect you to use calculus. Worthwhile as an intro econ course.", "The course was challenging. Granted, it was my first semester at princeton, so I was unprepared for the level of difficulty I encountered. If you keep up with the readings and read the lecture notes, you'll be fine. Its not a hard class to pass.", "The information is definitely important to know, but Farber does not explain it very clearly.", "The information is pretty useful-- it's good to take this course just to understand general economic principles. However, make sure you research the instructor before signing up.", "The lectures weren't very helpful, so as long as your read the book and the slides you should be fine. Work with others on problem sets  since some problems weren't on materials we had covered in lectures so we had to figure a lot of stuff on our own. Only take it because it's a requirement for econ.", "The material is important, however it is by no means the most engaging class you will take at Princeton.", "The problem sets take a while but the material isn't very hard.

If that's what you're looking for then it may be for you.  You don't have to attend lecture at all if you don't want, and problem sets take up only a few hours.

You will learn an entirely new way of thinking about markets and how people make choices. If you are familiar all with math or science, the course will be very easy.", "This is an easy course.  Covers vital information for a tax-paying voter.  You need this course.  Farber is great.", "Very important subject matter if you are considering a career in economics or finance. I would definitely take it", "When taking this class find a study group of students who are way smarter than you and have taken economics before and learn from them. They will be your path to a good grade and understanding of the material. Unfortunately, if you have questions about the problem set, going to a preceptor or the lecturer will do little to help. Your study group will be key. Only take this course if it is a prerequisite. If you want to take an Econ class for general knowledge take Macroeconomics because that is much more applicable to the real world. But if you are taking this class make a study group for the problem sets and take notes at every precept.", "While I did not find this course particularly interesting, it is a useful course for those majoring in economics or looking for an easy credit course.", "Work on the problem sets early in the week so that you can go to office hours if you need help on any of the problems. Also, make sure to go over the answer keys to the problem sets after they are posted.", "Yes, microeconomics is a good foundation that you need for a lot of your studies here.", "You can definitely take this course as you will learn at least a 100times more than you did making the AP microeconomics classes.

You'll learn a bunch and regardless of whether you plan to pursue COS or something else in math, science, social science, or humanities, you'll enjoy the assignments and the sense that you know a bunch about how to solve these kinds of problems!\n- 226 is very much a continuation of 126.  If you liked that, you'll probably like this.  Yes this *is* harder, but only in terms of amount of content.  The programming is not too much more difficult.\n- This class is much easier in terms of time spent than 217.  I'm a systems person, so I liked 217 better, but I will freely recognize that the 226 assignments took about half as much time.\n- The course is really front loaded! First half of the semester you have 1 assignment a week.  Second half its 1 assignment every 2 weeks.  They don't get any harder.  Stick with it if you can!  The first assignment is the hardest.  Unlike 217, there's no Dean's Date assignment.\n- As always, start assignments early.  There's a pseudo-requirement that you read the assignment before precept.  If you actually start it before precept, you'll get more out of precept, be able to ask more questions and get more help during precept, and probably finish before the weekend's even started.  That's pretty nice.\n- Study for exams by taking the practice exams and looking over the exercises.  A lot of the \"easy\" exam problems are very similar to the exercises, and it's nice to get those without thinking and save time for the question(s) that ask you to come up with algorithms for things!\n- Wonderful class, take it!

But hey - at the end of the semester, you'll be able to read, write and understand so many more Chinese characters!!! Totally worth it.", "Just put in the time and you will definitely learn Chinese.", "Princeton's Chinese program is known as the best for a reason. The instruction is top notch and I would sign up for this class again straight away if I were to restart this semester. Consider taking the later weekly exam slot as that gives you another hour to practice writing characters. If you don't slack off on reading the text and learning characters you will do fine in the class. The tough curve is a bummer though, but that shouldn't deter you from learning a skill that will be extremely useful.", "Take it and work hard. Review on your own a LOT.

The curve is difficult, but if you are willing to put in the time, you will do well.", "Take it, but accept that it's a language course and there will be a silly curve for A's", "Take it, even if you don't think your Chinese is very good. As long as you have some knowledge of Chinese, you will be fine in the course. The frequent drilling and quizzes really help you improve. It's not that difficult if you just work hard and stay on top of the work. You really bond with your classmates - it's such a fun class! You will  be impressed by how much you have improved by the end of the term.", "Take it. You won't regret it.", "The workload is pretty intense, but not much thinking required. Just make sure you devote enough time to it. Definitely improves your Chinese.", "This class requires a lot of work, but you really do improve your Chinese. The professors are really cool and funny, so it's really easy to approach and ask them questions. This was arguable my favorite class. The workload was a little intense sometimes, but it's manageable after you get used to the schedule of this class.", "Work hard, it's worth it. And it's all completely doable, you'll find that memorizing characters gets easier and easier. Use as many opportunities as you can to practice speaking. A very good Chinese course for the \"native\" speaker who can't write, or even, in my case, for the person who can't speak that well either. Don't doubt yourself if you can hardly speak; you'll find that the Chinese of your childhood that you forgot will resurface quickly.", "You will be expected to spend at the VERY minimum, an hour a night preparing for the course, and some of your classmates will spend upwards of 5 hours (the day before) preparing for weekly quizzes. I spend several hours on Sundays preparing flashcards and vocab and at least an hour a day on homework and I still struggle with remembering all the characters we learn. Also be forewarned that there are quizzes every single Friday. In true Chinese fashion this course is very demanding but you will be amazed with how much you will learn, even in the first two weeks.

Here are some techniques which helped me to get the most out of my very limited time:\n\nEngaging in Class:  Make an effort in your head to think about every question asked in class so that you can multiply your own practice time -- even the ones not asked to you.  If you find your attention dwindling, you can silently try to whisper the questions as the teacher is asking them -- see if you can keep up with them and stay focused the whole time.\n\nTones:  It's best to never, ever allow yourself to get a tone incorrect even once.  Always pay attention and Never Ever Guess!  After even the first time you make a mistake on a tone, you will be tempted to make the same mistake many more times on the same word.  As far as I can tell, the most important part of learning tones is getting them correct immediately, and correcting them as soon as you discover you made an error.  This aspect of the language can't be ignored because even though the teachers and classmates may understand you when the tones are wrong, most Chinese people find it extremely difficult to understand you when the tones are even slightly off.  To help: as you learn the words, make a deliberate effort to store words in separate areas of your mind based on tones, and take the tones seriously.  If you make mental pictures to store words, set those pictures in separate areas -- if you use flashcards, group the flashcards by tone at some point.  And, as I said, do not guess.\n\nMaking Recordings: These are an amazing opportunity to get your Chinese to be fluid and natural as long as you are willing to spend a lot of time perfecting them.  I really think that during the first year my Chinese developed the most through these recordings.  I would generally say each passage at least a dozen times before posting, starting by singling out and", "This class requires that you put a lot of time and energy into it - studying last minute before the weekly tests is not recommendable, and ultimately not very productive.", "This course is very difficult, with almost an absurd amount of material each week, but you will learn a lot.", "Very difficult.", "Very helpful and if you're interested, definitely take it", "Watch out.

If you are, there is no better way to learn Chinese in America.", "You need to have a background in Chinese to take 105. I took four years of Chinese in high school and even took the AP Chinese test but still placed into 105, even though it's only second-year Chinese, and I felt I was in the right place.

For one thing, they are absolutely wonderful.  Professor Alsdorf is amazing at weaving together analysis of paintings into a larger argument about periods and styles.  For another, there isn't reading (outside of perhaps a few paragraphs in the textbook) on all the artists covered in the course (and on the exams).  There are just too many.\n- There are some precepts in the art museum, which adds to the fun of analyzing painting and sculpture when it is right in front of you instead of on a slide.  There are blackboard responses on the readings due the day before precept, graded on a is it there/is it not there basis.\n- Reading load varies week to week.  You have to cite relevant readings on the exams, even if they were not covered in precept.  So save time for the extra readings before midterms week - I wish I had!\n- For me, the second paper was due before winter break, not on Dean's Date.  This is a challenge, so make sure you have your topic picked out by the end of Thanksgiving.  (Be careful about finding books in Marquand, people check books out to the reading room for a couple weeks and suddenly there's a lot less left about your artist!)\n- All in all, this was a WONDERFUL course that I would strongly recommend for people interested in art history or looking for a distribution.  There's something in the art of this period for almost everyone (unless you only like buildings... then take something more medieval) and it's easier to make coherent sense out of a century or two than half of art history.

I personally wasn't all that interested in chemistry, but still found this class to be fair. One downside is that the labs do require a lot of work and it can at times feel as if you are taking two separate classes just in terms of the workload that you have to deal with.

I would recommend taking this class over a lot of other science classes offered at princeton.", "I would encourage other students to take the course.", "I would mainly recommend this course because Hecht was a good lecturer.

If you stay on top of the material, your readings, and problem-sets, you will probably understand the lectures and exams 10 x better.  Therefore, you need to have the time to devote to the class.  The lectures are pretty cool, they are interesting, and the labs are pretty fun!  Personally, I liked the labs better but I think the class as a whole was pretty enriching.  The staff is very accessible as well and take advantage of their help, because this course is pretty challenging.

Good luck.  :)", "I would tell them that it would be highly helpful to have a good background in chemistry before entering this course, and that is something that I regret. I would also tell them to really try and use all of the different learning resources that are offered because they would help a lot.", "I've always enjoyed chemistry, and I still do, but I would advise students not to take this class unless they absolutely had to. It is far too unjustifiably time consuming. In addition, it isn't taught exceptionally and some sturdy improvements would do the course good.

Don't bother going to class.", "If needed for a pre-req or pre-med then its a perfectly fine course.", "If you are at all considering or interested in science, especially Chemistry, this is a superb course to take.

Dr. Hecht is a fantastic lecturer, and the workload isn't too bad.

It is hard to maintain, but it is definitely worth it.", "If you have to take it, take the lower level of chemistry, as its easier, but if you don't have to take chemistry, I suggest you go into clases that interest you more.", "If you need a refresher for basic chemical principles or never learned them in the first place, this is a great course. Hecht teaches well but make sure you keep up with the concepts, especially with bonding towards the end.", "If you read the weekly chapters, have a fair grasp on chemical principles, and attend McGraw review session, you might do well in this class.", "If you want to, do it. If not, there are other STLs.", "If you're into Chemistry or it's a BSE requirement, take it.

It sounds a LOT more interesting.", "Take this class if it's a pre-health requirement, but if you're just looking to fulfill a STL requirement there are probably better classes.", "Take this course if you have to, because it opens the door to a lot of other opportunities. I'd assume the average student likes chemistry a good bit more than I do, and of the chem courses I've taken in the past, this was the most tolerable.", "Take this course if your any bit interesting in chemistry, it definitely deepens your understanding of chemistry and labs are interesting.", "The chemistry itself is easy. The tests are thought provoking and there's many places to mess up. You can do fairly well if you work hard.", "The class is a very thorough intro to chemistry. As somebody that had never had chemistry, I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the speed and amount of material covered in the class, but for anybody that has had chemistry, it is probably a good review and extension of Gen Chem knowledge.", "The lectures are worth a lot more if you read/skim the book beforehand. Get a studygroup/partner for the problem sets, and go to McGraw frequently for help with them and to understand the material.", "The material can be challenging, but there are plenty of resources, like the Resource Center and McGraw.  It realy helps to start the problem sets when they're assigned, so you can work through them and really understand the material you're applying.  Definitely go to McGraw for help; other students are extremely helpful.  Read the chapters assigned before lecture.

Low grades are a trademark of the class, and all you can do is hope for the best. In the end, you will make some of the best friends in the process of working so closely with them.

If you have a strong background in math and enjoy a challenge, this course is for you. In the beginning, a number of people will understand the ideas being taught in class but have difficulties writing rigorous proofs. This is a correctable issue, and if you are in this position, you may find this class to be rewarding if you stick to it. However, if you have no idea what is going on during the first two weeks, do not hesitate to drop this class. My only complaint is that the problem sets are very time-consuming compared to the problem sets for analogous courses at places like MIT. Some people will take 7 hours per week on most problem sets, while others will take up to 25 or 30.", "I recommend this course; it shows a new approach to math that I believe is essential to any Math major, and useful for other scientific subjects.

It is a very good introduction to rigorous mathematics and very fun to take. It should be noted, however, that the course is very demanding. Expect to take 10  hours (might even be 15  for some weeks) on the problem sets if you have not had significant experience writing proofs before", "If you are considering being a math major, take this course.  Keep in mind though that the problem sets will take you 20 hours a week especially if you haven't been introduced to proof-based math before.  Overall I don't think the concepts are that difficult to grasp (in retrospect), but it is possible to work on one problem in vain for two or three hours before figuring it out.  In the end though, all the time you have invested into the course will be worth it.  My advice is to go to McGraw frequently and always find people to work with.  Tackling these problem sets alone is nearly impossible.", "If you are considering math as a major, this course is a great litmus test.

However, the rewards from actually completing the course far outweigh the effort put into it.", "Take this if you are interested in being a math major (or want some background for very high level microeconomics), but be prepared for a LOT of work.", "The course seems like you want to pull your hair out while you're doing proofs at 5 a.m. each Thursday morning. But don't be discouraged-- stick with the work. The effort definitely does go a long way, and it is worth it if you are interested in pursuing a field closely related to rigorous mathematics.", "This class is very difficult. I am glad that I took it, because I always wanted to take proof-based math, but make sure you know what you are getting into. Be prepared to spend about 30hrs a week on problem sets. Go to office hours, and go to Mcgraw, because otherwise there are problems you will never be able to solve. Work with other students.", "This course is very challenging if you have not taken a previous proof-based math course. While the course does teach you how to write proofs, you are also expected to learn the content at the same time, so balancing the two can be difficult. It seems that time spent on problem sets varies considerably from person to person: anywhere from 10 hours a week to 40  hours. However, the course is very rewarding and you will learn a great deal. I recommend that you take out a book from the library on analysis since Rudin tends to be very terse. In particular, \"Understanding Analysis\" by Abbott does a good job of explaining many of the concepts.", "This course was by far my favorite in freshman year. I took this course because I wanted to learn calculus from a rigorous perspective. I had not done any math competitions, proof based math, or college level math before this course so the initial learning curve was very high. Ultimately though, learning falls into your hands: as long as you love mathematics and devote time to this course, you will see a significant improvement in your clarity of thinking, proof writing, and problem solving ability. I secretly believe that all majors should take this class since it is a great test of being able to make logical connections to form a conclusion from a given set of assumptions. This course will show you the true side of math, mathematics beyond the brainless number crunching. The ideal renaissance liberal arts education would include this course. If you consider yourself an intellectual, this course is a must.", "This is a Lot of work.

It's a great way to keep everything in focus and to not let you lose sight of the real importance behind all the seemingly insignificant molecules and reactions (yes, reactions. don't underestimate the level of orgo needed for the course. you will be required to understand, and perhaps even draw out, certain mechanisms, especially for cofactors).", "This course is extremely difficult - hard to expect what will turn up on tests, lots of rote memorization and cramming, and the curve isn't good either. Professor Hughson is amazing though. He's very cute and funny, and is truly the best science teacher I've had at Princeton. He actually puts thought into how to best teach difficult concepts, he is really good at explaining things. If you didn't do well in orgo, don't worry, there is very little overlap. Of course, if you are taking this class, you probably are either CHM or pre-med, and don't have much choice in the matter..Hughson makes this necessary evil much more bearable.

While this course does involve proofs, you are helped along with the proofs in the homeworks.  It also involves a significant amount of applications of complex analysis, any many of the textbook homework problems were based on computation rather than proof.

Grades pretty much entirely based on a midterm and final that both consist of take home \"design challenges\". In this case, a design challenge is essentially a longer than usual homework assignment. They are both easy, with unlimited time over several weeks to complete them. This means that most people get I know got every question generally correct. Nelson likes to keep her averages lower than any other CBE course (in both Reactors and this class), which means that she asks the preceptors to ensure that there is a \"distribution\" on the midterm and final. This means that you can do objectively well on the two challenges, but end up in the B minus range due to a couple silly sign errors. If Nelson revamps the grading by either offering more difficult challenges (so the distribution is based on real differences in ability/work), or by switching to standard exams, this course may improve. As is, I would highly recommend against it.", "This class is OK, but nowhere near as interesting as I originally thought it would be based on the title and description. Particularly if you are not a chemE, be wary of taking the course. Not because it's difficult (although obviously some mathematical literacy is a prerequisite), but because the class has a strong chemE bias, both in terms of how material is taught - they should rename this class \"pretend everything in the body is a freaking pipe\" - and the subtle condescension that Prof. Nelson exhibits towards non chemical engineers. You'll certainly learn some interesting physiology, but the quantitative aspect is limited only to a few situations (most of which involve pipes, btw). Quite frankly, you could learn all of the interesting parts in this course in an afternoon with Wikipedia and the materials available from Harvard/MIT's analogous Quantitative Physiology course (all freely available via OpenCourseWare), which, incidentally, is the source for over 50% of the problem set questions (and solutions). Overall, the class is still moderately interesting, but that's only because the material itself is inherently so and not because of the Professor. Slides are useless (95% pictures taken from medical textbooks), labs are useless (cut open a cow heart and look; big deal), precepts were rehashments of lecture, and though the problems aren't ridiculously hard, it is still hard to do well in the class because of the grading style.

We will also consider how the afterlife of 19th-century poetry haunts our conception of literary \"modernism.\"", "termid": "1122", "classes": [{"classnum": "20600", "enroll": "8", "limit": "20", "starttime": "1:30 pm", "section": "S01", "endtime": "2:50 pm", "roomnum": "48", "days": "TTh", "bldg": "McCosh Hall"}]},

Definitely take this class.", "The professor makes the materials seem very easy and interesting but exams are a lot harder. A lot of materials to memorize.", "This class helps you learn a lot about psychology, but it is tough to get a good grade in. The mid term is pretty hard, and it graded very tough. The final is a bit easier, but this class is by no means an easy A. Its interesting material, and if you're interested in psychology, Oppenheimer is a great lecturer. If you are incredibly concered with getting an A, this class might not be for you.

This isn't to say you can't learn and do well - you certainly can and I know many people in my situation who did! - but it will be a slog and very frustrating before it is rewarding.\n- Until they fix it, there are not nearly enough office hours for the size of the class.  Don't be shy about asking to schedule an appointment, and do it AS SOON as you get behind.  This is NOT a class where you can catch up if you get confused at the beginning.  Ask for help (even the people getting 100% on everything need help) as soon as you need it.\n- That said, the topics in this class are very interesting and relevant.  There are parts that are a great complement to what you learn in 226 (probably a good idea to take 226 before taking this, if you are unfamiliar with the material, although plenty of people take them together).

Essentially, getting help in this course was impossible.\n\nBecause of the competition on problem sets, the exclusive nature of the partner work we did, and the inability to get help from the TAs, this class felt like a smart competition.  So, if you're \"smart\" in math, you'll probably enjoy this class, but if you're not you'll probably just feel like an idiot most of the time.  That being said, this course is pretty much an informal COS department requirement, so find a good partner and put your thinking cap on.", "The topics covered in the class are really interesting, but it would be just as good to get a copy of the text and read it on your own than take this class.
