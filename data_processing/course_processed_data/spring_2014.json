The knowledge I gained is very helpful and there is a tremendous amount of resources available for help on the problem sets and in better understanding the concepts mentioned in class.", "I would recommend taking the course, but I would mention that Lab TA hours are super helpful and super crowded, so get there early and expect to stay late.", "I would recommend that students attend the lectures and really pay attention to the material in the book.

By starting earlier, the resources available can be better utilized.", "I would recommend the course. I learned a ton even though it wasn't my number one priority for the semester.", "I would recommend this course to anyone with any interest in computer science.  You will be so proud of all that you learned.  Do allot plenty of time to do some readings ahead of lecture, as this helps you to keep up with the fast pace.", "I would recommend this course to anyone, especially if professor Clark is teaching it.", "I would say to manage your time well and to budget coding sessions throughout the week. Being able to walk away from the code for a little when frustrated was a great thing.", "I would tell them to make sure to get a good preceptor that explains the material well, and to schedule their time appropriately for the assignments.", "IF THERE IS ONE COURSE THAT IS A MUST-TAKE AT PRINCETON, IT IS THIS COURSE!!! Honestly, Professor Clark's lectures are engaging, the assignments are fun and challenging, and you are given the tools to go from knowing nothing about computer science to being very competent in it. Computer science can be applicable to almost any other subject in this day and age, and knowing how to code is a skill that is useful in all walks of life. Even more so than learning to code in this class, however, you are taught how to think. If you want to better your critical thinking skills, learn a useful skill, and possibly fall in love with an entirely new academic discipline, take this course!", "If you are technically minded, feel free to take it if you don't mind some stress and a workload.  If you are an AB major and have difficulty using Word, this is not the class for you.", "If you are to choose any precepts, make sure Donna Gabai or Maia Ginsburg are teaching them. They are skilled and experienced.", "If you don't understand an aspect of programming, ask before continuing; everything builds as the semester goes.", "If you have any interest in CS, take this class in freshman fall. You learn a lot, and it makes a big difference to start early. It's one of the best-taught courses I've seen so far, and I strongly recommend that you take it.", "If you have even a passing interest or curiosity about computer science and programming, you owe it to yourself to take this course. This is one of the most taken, most polished courses on campus. From what I can see, taking this class in the spring is preferable, especially if you have no computer science background (like myself). This is because 1) Professor Clark is one of the best lecturers I've had and 2) more of your inexperienced friends and engineers will take it then, so you'll get to work together or at least struggle together. Be aware that this class has a huge range in difficulty for different individuals. Although I didn't know anything about programming or COS before this course, I found this class to be very manageable and rewarding. I had friends with similar levels of experience who had to drop the course because it simply wasn't clicking for them. Also, I'd recommend against PDF'ing this class; there's a lot of work needed to pass the class, but if you can get that far, you're probably going to at least get a B anyways.", "If you have the time, take it.", "If you're a humanities kid looking to fulfill a QR requirement and learn something new, I wouldn't recommend this class. PDFing it doesn't really help because you still have a huge workload. This class is very, very time consuming.", "If you're a non-science person, like me: don't be afraid to ask questions and to ask for help, start the assignments early, do practice exams and make sure you have enough time in the semester to devote consistent attention to the class. It's an incredibly-well-organized class and you will learn a lot, but bear in mind that it is time-consuming.", "If you're at all interested in CS, take this course! It's well-run, and you'll learn to code in one semester with no prior experience.", "If you're debating placing out of this course, do so. You won't get as much as you might think you will from taking it. If you haven't taken any COS before, also take it. It is taught well and will give you an essential skill for an ever more technology based world.", "If you're interested in computer science, this is the BEST course to start with!", "If you've coded before, don't get cocky. The written exams aren't as easy as you might think. Don't miss lectures about TOY, machine code, or binary - stuff that's theory and not Java. Those will throw you off on the exams if you're not careful. Also, I found those lectures to be the most interesting.", "If you've never learned JAVA before, the book helps a lot. Also, even if you have, keep in mind that assignments can take hours and you should always start early.", "It is a wonderful course, and really opens your eyes up to the power of computers. You should definitely take it, even if you don't plan on using computer science ever in the future.", "It is very time consuming make sure to start early on all assignments and studying", "It's a demanding course.", "It's a good class so take it but be aware of the time commitment.", "It's a great class and you learn a lot in only one semester- but beware! You won't be able to get away without doing any work even if you are PDFing. Be prepared to work really hard and if you feel like you are not doing well, seek help from the beginning.", "It's a great course to get an understanding of programming and applications. The assignments are very interesting and there's a good cohesion between precepts, assignments, and lectures. Also, attend lab TA hours whenever you need help (preferably earlier than the night before it's due). Period.", "It's a great opportunity to learn programming and the big ideas in computer science. If you're even considering taking this course, you should. Computer science skills are valuable in many academic disciplines and fields of work - if you don't take the course now, you will regret it when you are in the working world.", "It's allot of work but very rewarding!", "It's extremely useful, just be prepared to spend 6-10 hours per week on the assignments if you are new to coding.", "It's literally a necessity for BSE freshmen, and it's fun for everyone else, just try to get a good preceptor or find someone (maybe a lab TA?) who can answer your questions", "It's no walk in the park.", "It's very enjoyable and useful.", "Its interesting and helpful if you have interest in computers.", "Just follow all the advice the lecturers and preceptors give you--especially about starting the problem sets early.", "Keep on top of the workload, and try to understand the basics from the beginning.", "Keep up with the material and assignments.  Attend precepts.  Use lab hours and Piazza as needed for help.", "Keep up with the work and you'll get the most out of the course!", "Loved the problem sets. Make sure to get 20/20 on all of them bc the grade is not curved (found that out too late) so you'll need every point.", "MUST take it before you graduate.", "Make sure that you get a competent preceptor as they will likely make or break you in this class.  They cut down the amount of self learning that you have to do.", "Make sure that you go to lab TAs and office hours if you have questions.", "Make sure to attend precepts, and office hours and TA hours are a great resource that everyone should use. The earlier you start assignments, the less stressful they will be to complete.", "Make sure to do all the practice - ex. Websheets because they allow you to fully understand the concepts. And it is also a very good class to take even if you are not a COS/engineering student.", "Make sure to do the readings BEFORE the lectures so the lectures will be more helpful. Go to office hours on a consistent basis (even review topics covered in lectures if you don?t have any issues with the assignments), and use Piazza!", "Make sure to get Donna Gabai as your preceptor, and make sure you start the programming assignments as early as possible.", "Make sure to keep up with your work.", "Make sure to stay on top of the readings, and pay attention to the minute details about coding techniques and such brought up in lecture and the readings because they will be necessary in preparation for the written exam which is quite different from the coding assignments.", "Make sure you have the time to devote to this course and start assignments early", "Make sure you take the time to understand the material if you decide to take it.", "Make sure you umdrstand what's going on early in the course because it provides a foundation for everything else in the semester.", "Make sure your basics are strong.", "Not a fan unless your pdf or have previous coding experience.", "Not worth PDFing for the amount of hours you need to put in per week", "One of my favorite classes at princeton. Really teaches you how to think and everyone should take this course.", "Only take if interested in computer science", "Pay very close attention the first couple weeks, because the course only builds from there", "Practice programming even outside the assignments, and keep up with your theory.", "Practice with lots of past written examinations.", "Prepare well for the written exams", "Programming exams are you either get it or you don't. Other than that the course was very interesting.", "Programming is an absolute must of a life skill that you need to learn, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend learning it by taking COS 126. It is a fun and very interesting class, but you could learn more object-oriented programming by just taking AP CS in high school (which most people in the class have done before taking the course)", "Read the booksite/textbook!", "Read the textbook, start assignments early, and try not to get frustrated. Don't take this if you are not interested. It is incredibly time consuming if you haven't had prior coding experience and aren't naturally amazing at it. Even PDFing it would be hard.", "Seek help. There are so many resources available for this course- office hours, lab ta's, piazza. Take advantage of them. People hate debugging code as much as you do. It is better to ask someone who made a commitment to help you than to ask a friend to look over your code when they are probably busy with their own work.", "Shop preceptors because I had the worst one imaginable. She was very condescending, laughed when we got questions wrong or asked dumb questions, and kept asking us how we didn't understand the material.  We didn't understand it because she went over it in under 10 minutes every precept so we spend the last 40 minutes sitting there confused while she laughed at us. SHOP PRECEPTORS! And go to lab TA office hours of course.", "So hard, so good. Even if you don't understand everything, it's worth it to learn some new, important, and interesting things.", "Start all projects early and don't be afraid to ask for help.", "Start assignments ahead of time, and take full advantage of the help available...there's so much help available that you should not have to spend a ridiculous amount of time finding one bug (although you should be able to debug on your own). If you're stuck, just ask! Also, partner programming can be a good experience, but tend to take more time than doing the assignment on your own, so always plan ahead.", "Start assignments early so that you don't have to debug under time constraints.", "Start assignments early. Don't get stuck on a problem in your code for too long, take it to Lab TAs or office hours, right away! And do yourself a favor and get Donna, Dave, Maia, or Judi as a preceptor.

Everyone says this, because it is true: COS 126 is one of the best classes offered at Princeton. You will never have the opportunity to learn intro computer science in a more supportive, more well-organized environment than you will here. Doug Clark is hysterical, and an incredible lecturer.

It's fantastic! It is a lot of work especially if coding is hard for you but it's worth it and such interesting information to know!", "Take this course! Lectures are great, preceptors are great, and the subject is interesting! Be prepared for quite a bit of work, but it's so worth it.", "Take this course! Put in the work and take advantage of the resources if you need them. However, if you like problem solving and you think logically this class shouldn't be too hard and you will really enjoy it and learn alot.", "Take this course, but be prepared to do readings that actually matter.", "Take this course, especially if Doug Clark is lecturing.

It was extremely interesting, I learned a lot in a short span of time, and I am now aware of the basics that would help me if I wanted to learn other languages or get even better at Java.", "This class is good for PDF if you have no prior programming knowledge. It is an interesting and useful but somewhat challenging QR class for those with little or no prior programming experience.", "This class is great and the material is very useful to know no matter what you you are studying.", "This class's workload is really not that bad. I would take it at all possible. I truly enjoyed it.", "This course is a must-take.", "This course is an amazing introduction to computer science and should become part of every student's core curriculum.", "This course is fantastic, definitely take it, and take it with Professor Clark in the Spring, as he is so funny and makes the lectures an absolute delight to attend. Get either Donna Gabai, or Dave Pritchard as your preceptor, as they are both excellent. This course might be a fair bit of work if you have never programed before, but you will not regret taking this course. The assignments are also very interesting and there is lots of help available, always!", "This is a great class that is very well run, with interesting assignments. There is a lot of support and help if you need it. Take it!", "This is a great course to take to get some basic knowledge of coding especially if you've never had any experience with it in your life (like me). Yes, the weekly assignments do take some time and it's kind of stressful knowing that there's this project due that don't know how long it will take to finish. The Lab TA's are helpful and the regular TA's are helpful too. The grading is tough though because you are compared to people who have been coding their whole lives because everyone has to take this course. Because people come from all different levels, Princeton's most general coding class does go pretty fast because they have to get to things that the coders maybe haven't done before. Keep up with the work; do the websheets and extra practice codes as you learn in addition to the weekly assignments. Overall, I was happy that I took this class even though my grades are terrible compared to people who get 100s on everything and code all the time (and I had to PDF) because I'm coming out with a applicable skill.", "This is one of the best run and best taught classes at Princeton. It offers a solid introduction into what programming is about and how computers work.", "This is such a good choice. One of my biggest Princeton regrets was waiting until so late in the game to take COS classes. This course in particular is a well-oiled machine. They've clearly put so, so, so much work into perfecting it, and it runs smoothly. It's a shame Dr. Israel won't be around next year as a preceptor because I felt she taught us very well and really focused on the important things during our precept meetings. That said, I've heard there are other phenomenal preceptors. Clark is a great lecturer, really engaging and always seeming so excited to teach us from his vast base of knowledge. The assignments aren't as scary as you may think before you take a COS class, and many are actually fun. The written exams are doable but just very long given the 50 minute time. Don't let that discourage you though. Incredible class.", "Try to get a good preceptor, especially if you need this as a graded course. I was lucky to be able to P/D/F it.", "Try to motivate yourself once you catch yourself slipping. Catching up right before the final exam was not very fruitful.", "Use the TAs, and start programming early.", "Use the lab TAs and office hours!

A ton of work though and a class I would definitely recommend against taking senior spring!", "Whether you're an engineer, mathematician, economist, or historian, take this course. Doug Clark and his small army of preceptors are excellent teachers, the material is, in today's age, universally applicable, and eye-opening to the realm of computer science, even to the layman.

The sunday excersises are incredibly annoying as you pretty much have to get 30/30 on every exercise, which can take 3-5 hours. However, these excersises do keep you up to date with the algorithms. When doing the assignments, read through the assignment page, checklist, and watch the videos. If you need help, go to Lab TA hours, but you should be fine. Most of the assignments are pretty straight forward. Code and test one step at a time and you will be fine. Debugging in this class is pretty straight forward, identify what is going wrong, where is it going wrong, how is it going wrong. If you do this you will be fine. If you code a little, test a little you can catch bugs early. For the midterm and exam take as many practice tests as possible. However focus on the more recent ones as some of the material on older exams may be outdated.  Learn how to trace through the algorithms that show up on those exams. Practice design questions like crazy. I took 226 with 217 and it is doable. If you decide to take them at the same time you have to work ahead. At first the two classes together are manageable. However, later in the semester the assignment deadlines start to overlap. 226 takes less time than 217, but you get less late days for 217. If you are someone who codes at the last minute, don't take these two classes together. You will also be coding/debugging a lot if you take these two classes together.

If you put forth effect, you will learn a tremendous amount about the topic covered in the course and enjoy yourself immensely in the process. Some students are often dissuaded from taking this course and others like it because they are not history or humanities majors and feel that they lack the background information to do well and get good grades in a course like this.  However, this course, while easier if you know something about the topic covered, requires no outside knowledge and if you challenge yourself and take this course, you will not only do well and get a good grade in the course but will find that you came away with a much deeper understanding of the period in question as well as the history of the world in general.  This professor manages to weave the history of the world into covering minute details and seemingly obscure periods of history, demonstrating how interconnected events in human history are.  Although I have been very interested in history since I was very young, have been reading all types of history and thought myself to be so well informed that there was little that I could learn from any particular class that would have particularly mindblowing insights, my first course with Professor Barry taught me otherwise.  In the process of taking this and other classes with him, I learned far more about the world as a whole and how different motivations shape decisions and events in world history than from any other course or school that I ever been in or taken classes at before.  Professor Barry's classes have changed the way I think and the view in which I view and approach the world around me.

This is because my preceptor was just really bad--long story short, we had a change in preceptors in the middle of the semester, and so the new preceptor just did a bad job at responding to and answering our questions. Then there is the fact that he took forever to grade the assignment---and his feedback was never really helpful even though he gave us a lot (it seemed he gave us quantity as opposed to quality; some of it was basic stuff that did not even relate to the paper). Thus it did not seem that it actually helped to improve the grade (I know a lot of people feel this way).", "If you're at all interesting in political philosophy, take it!

Decide on your paper topics early so that you can read with those implications in mind.", "Like with any other course, a recommendation to take it comes with the caveat of having some prior interest in the material. This sort of interest isn't inherently with freedom, democracy, government, and all that stuff, but rather, it is an interest towards philosophical and serious topics. People who have an idealistic view of the world, those who don't care for keeping up with politics or aren't seriously engaged with political issues, those who prefer to avoid controversy and go with the status quo, etc, will not find very much out of this course. But if you do like exploring new ideas, have a political orientation that you have reasoned, thought about, and acquired through looking at all sides of an issue and choosing one that best fits how you feel about the world, then taking this class should be a priority. \n\nIn taking this class, one thing to do is to find the best translation possible. Some authors, such as Hobbes, can be undecipherable if the translation is dated, or in the case of old English, left untranslated. Other translations adhere far too much to the original wording and grammar of the authors, and this too makes them undecipherable. Don't just go to labyrinth and buy the one on the list - shop around online for a translation of the text that you like, and that you can read and understand. You'll enjoy the course a lot more because of this.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that you won't like all the authors you read. They're all different, and they sort of have a life of their own. In such a case, you may be tempted to skip that author. Thanks to the organization of the course, that is entirely possible to do, or at least it was when I took it. I think the option to ignore authors whom you think are ridiculous and undecipherable is a very desirable trait in a course, and ought to be a feature in all courses. \n\nFinally, the course does not go into extreme depth. It is meant to provide an overview, and that is a good thing. This means that", "Lots of students don't attend lecture because Professor Ryan uploads all his notes - however, I did because he is very famous and for the most part interesting.

The readings certainly stand on their own, and they should definitely incorporate Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Rousseau, Machiavelli, Marx, and Mill into their education.

Which is a lot of humanities and social science classes.", "Take this course, do all the readings, and go to precept.  Lectures are optional, only go if you were confused about the reading or want some extra context.", "The jury's out to lunch, since the legendary Alan Ryan (who was perhaps the chief reason to take this course. Really. He was incredibly erudite and also adorable) has now retired. Depends entirely on the professor; the course itself rests on that.", "They recently changed the course curriculum. If you don't like writing a lot of pointless papers and you don't write quickly, then I wouldn't recommend this class.", "This is really a history class of political theory before the 20th century.

Some of the criticisms are legitimate and interesting. I actually really enjoyed learning about prospect theory. Others are, as noted before, based on really silly methodology.

The only benefit that I felt I received from taking it was getting access to the software and equipment; beyond that, it seemed like everything I learned I had to teach myself. Prof. Sanborn is nice, but he is not a very engaging speaker, and he seems to have little interest in explaining the practicalities of moviemaking. Many of our classes consisted of a 3-hour Powerpoint on highly theoretical subjects which had little or nothing to do with film; maybe that would be fine for a more advanced class, it was unhelpful for those of us who were beginners and had no background in the technical aspects. Discussion of basic things like equipment, vocabulary, storyboarding and composition, and the industry as a whole were few and far between, and the short films we watched in class were overwhelmingly artsy, experimental pieces, rather than the narrative or documentary features that most of us were interested in making. Moreover, the department is trying to switch over from teaching Final Cut to Adobe Premiere, so many of our classes consisted of watching the professor for hours while he tried to figure out the software, rather than navigating it ourselves. The readings were never discussed in class, and overall I think it would have been helpful if more things had been committed to paper: I would have appreciated a list of basic vocabulary terms and concepts at the beginning of the year, for example, and having printed directions for the software would have allowed us to practice things like the special effects, color correction, and audio cleanup individually - a more efficient use of time than watching a three-hour demonstration.

The lectures try to give you a sense of the fundamentals behind a number of statistical concepts and algorithms, and after finishing the class I really felt that I thoroughly understood things. The HW nicely complements this by looking at applications (e.g. spam filtering, image classification). You're given a piece of R-code to start with that essentially solves a simpler version of the HW problem, which you then have to 'tweak'. This way, you can really get in depth on the applications, and after this course I also felt confident I could deal with more complicated applications. Workload for HWs is very doable though, so don't worry about that. Beyond the homework, we only had a final, on which the open questions contained some curveballs, so beware. Finally, the TA's (especially Kevin Lin) are very helpful, respond quickly, and are clearly enthusiastic about the material.

The only good part about the homework is that it's extremely short, but that just means that if you want to learn the material you will have to do it on your own. Textbook is awful as well. I absolutely love physics, and the only way I got through this class was through watching MIT lecture videos and reading Giancoli, which is a pretty good intro physics textbook. The one this class uses is Tipler and Mosca, and it is nonsensical and a pain to read. Avoid taking this class if you can, but if you have to take it just understand that you'll be learning everything by yourself. It's not impossible because there are lot of good physics resources out there ? it's just sad that the physics department doesn't care about getting people interested in the subject. If possible, take intro math or computer science classes instead.", "Understand the problem sets, do practice quizzes when they're posted on blackboard.

Don't take unless you have to, and if you do, go to MIT open courseware and look at Walter Lewin's lectures.

In its current state, attending lectures and precepts are a waste of time. Watch the MIT OpenCourseware version of the course (8.02), and you'll learn so so so much more in 45 minutes than you will in the entire 8 hours of class a week. It's a terrible course, which is a shame because Electricity and Magnetism is such an awesome field. As I said, you have to take it. If you can get Juan Uson as your preceptor, DO IT.

First, hope you get a good preceptor. Second, if Tully is still teaching, you won't get any quiz averages, he won't answer your emails (or do what he says he will if he does answer them), and you'll feel that lecture is pointless. If you can, watch Walter Lewin's OCW videos out of class and zone out or do other things during lecture, which you will have to attend, because of iClickers. Do your problem sets with other people so they don't take up the time they're not worth in your week. Third, maybe if you all try hard you can inspire a little organization in this course, because we had none. We never knew how well we were doing in the course, problem sets, exams, and labs were all extremely hit or miss, and by the end it's evident that neither the instructors or the students care much. The instructors don't know what the other instructors are teaching and many are basically guessing about what the exam will be like and what you need to know due to lack of centralization. Unfortunately, you may not have a better alternative, because I have heard the same problems in 106 (although you will probably learn more there, they have apparently not put up practice finals yet. Their exam is a week away). For some reason, the physics department likes to see 103/104 as a service they're forced to provide for the university as opposed to a way to introduce non-majors to how interesting and useful physics is, and 105/106 as a way to weed out the potential physics majors they don't want to have. I think E&M is actually kind of cool and would be worth really learning about, but I was not inspired to do that whatsoever by this course. Get through it, study for quizzes and exams but don't be too put out if it doesn't pay off--it may not really have been your fault.

I don't think this is something that the professors can control, but outside of the typical lab course prereqs students needed to take to get here, if you have done research before and written up manuscripts on your results and such for an internship or whatever, you have a huge advantage over students who have not. That is not to say that you will not do well without experience, it's just that the overall methodology of doing a lit review for your intro, understanding how to present results and figures, and writing up a pertinent discussion, etc. are all things that are relatively novel (unfortunately due to the fact that our prereq lab courses have really inane and pointless lab write ups) for most students at this point. \n\nGeneral advice for doing well in this class:\n\n1. Go to every lecture. Take thorough notes.\n\n2. Do lab write ups in your book before each session. The book is only 5% of your grade but honestly the benefits of staying on track with it are much greater and will help you on reports and such in the long run.

It would be a very easy P/D/F.", "It's interesting, but a lot of work for pdf course.", "It's not a theology class, so there isn't as much study of the Bible as I expected. You'll mostly study what various other Christian authors have written. Very good class though - you'll learn a lot, especially if you do all the readings.\n\n(Although he grades easily enough that you may not have to do all the readings to get a solid A- ).", "Its an easy and good class, there's no reason not to take it.", "Its not as amazing as people claim it is.", "Keep up with the readings.", "Know that despite its reputation as a distribution-requirement-fulfilling class, it can be both 1) very interesting, and 2) difficult. Do the readings, pay attention in lecture, and you will do fine. Also, choose Adam Eitel as your preceptor.", "Make sure to do all the readings before precept and lectures. You will take a lot more out of the class.", "Make sure you do the readings and understand that this is a good P/D/F class but not a blow off class.", "OK distribution requirement. Keep up with reading. Lectures aren't the most entertaining.", "One of my favorite classes at Princeton.", "One of the best classes I have taken at Princeton! Strongly recommend", "People love this class - I didn't love it, but I thought it was worth it to take. It's much less interesting to take if you have very little Christian background, because the second half of the course deals primarily with how Christians could/should engage in society, which I didn't find particularly interesting or relevant. If you're interested in religion and its relevance in the context of society, this is a great class for you. If you're newer to religion and want to learn more about its foundation, this probably isn't the class for you.", "Pretty easy PDF.  I found lectures more boring than others have said", "Probably better to take it for a grade than PDF it.", "Relatively easy, especially for Christians with some theological/ethical training. Professor Gregory is great, and really seeks to make students develop a deeper understanding of ethics than the vague, simple liberal tendencies typical of this institution.", "Should be a necessary class to take in order to graduate.", "So if you're low on time, consider this for the final/midterm (worked very well for me): get together a group of friends, and you each do ONE WEEK of reading really thoroughly. Take notes, summarize the main concepts and thoughts, vocabulary the people are using, everything that will be helpful for the midterm/final. Then trade your notes with each other, meet up and talk about it. That way you all have all the knowledge and can talk about all the readings on the exams, without having to have put in the time to read all of them. Huge time saver.", "So some of the reviews I read coming in said that even if you were an atheist or didn't have a lot of background/knowledge regarding Christianity or religion in general, it would still be a riveting class.  I did not find this to be the case.  I thought some subjects and arguments were very engaging and interesting, but those turned out to be the non-religious parts of the argument.  And even if not having a Christian background technically doesn't hurt you on exams or papers, soooooooo many people in precept just pull Bible verses out of their pockets and are throwing them around and I'm just sitting there like...ok.  This doesn't mean you'll suck in precept, you just won't be able to engage as much if your preceptor doesn't make sure to bring it back to an ethics, rather than religious discussion.  I would take it, but it doesn't deserve its high rating.", "Strongly recommend! I have gained so much perspective in a lot of different social issues. Reading work is heavy, so divide it with a friend.", "TAKE THIS CLASS!", "TAKE THIS COURSE AND DO THE READINGS!", "THERE IS A LOT OF READING.", "Take a different EM if you just need to take this course for a distribution requirement.

Do the readings if you can, won't be a waste of time.", "Take it! The lectures are interesting and it is a thought-provoking class", "Take it, lots of fun!", "Take it. Get Melanie Webb as your preceptor cause she is awesome! It is a good class because it exposes your to Christian and non-Christian perspectives on big issues, forcing you to really understand where you stand and why you stand there. It's not doctrinal, so if you're not Christian, it is a nice intro to what Christianity is about. The papers are excellent because they force you to create really strong arguments. The exams are very straightforward and dare-I-say easy if you go to lectures and do ~70% or more of the readings.", "Take it. It's interesting.", "Take it. The best class I have taken hands down.", "Take it. This is a phenomenal class between the readings and the teaching.

Coming from someone who is not Christian, it was a very valuable look at an important ethical framework.", "Take the course, particularly if you come from a Christian background or have an interest in religion/Christianity.", "Take this class!  It was so interesting and it challenges many assumptions about and even interpretations within Christianity.  It really makes you think about our current society and what it will become with or without religion.", "Take this class! I just took it because it sounded interesting, even though I already fulfilled the distribution requirement and I didn't need it for a departmental. It turned out to be pretty great like everyone said.", "Take this class. This opens your eyes to so many different issues regarding Christian views on almost every controversial issue. Helps us understand what it means to be a Christian.", "Take this course for an interesting, PDF distribution requirement.", "Take this course if you need to PDF an EM", "Take this course!", "Take this course!!! it is my favorite class I have taken at Princeton so far! Great way to fulfill a EM requirement.", "Take this if you need it for a requirement. Know all the main points of the readings for the exams. Talk to your preceptors about the papers if you don't know how to write a philosophy paper.", "The course is fair to all perspectives; you don't have to be a Christian or well-trained in ethics to do well in the course (though I suppose it might help). If you want to explore current topics along with general ethics from a perspective that includes Christianity, this is a great course.", "The material is very interesting; the lectures are a tad dry sometimes.", "This class is fairly enjoyable. If you're looking for solid answers, you might be disappointed, but it's helpful to be exposed to many different ideas surrounding these complex and controversial issues.", "This class is kind of like going to church.  Gregory is preachy, although he has some funny stories to tell (e.g., midget tossing).  Also there are SO many authors you are responsible for on the midterm and final it makes it really difficult to PDF.  You still have to do the readings and at that point you might as well take the class for a grade, since your workload will not be reduced all that much.", "This course is excellent for both Christians and non-Christians. There is much to learn concerning the debates on these modern ethical issues. Dr. Gregory does a great job in \"unpacking\" all of the related arguments.", "This course is really stimulating, ESPECIALLY if you have a good preceptor. If your preceptor's not great it'll still be fine, but really helps if you have that.", "This course meshes well with Michael Smith's introductory class on Moral Philosophy.  The readings are great, but there are a lot of them and a few are somewhat dense.  It might be helpful to form a study group.  Also, be cognizant of the fact that the final exam is cumulative and that you are required to memorize the names of the authors of the readings for both the midterm and final exam.", "This is a fun course that is not too much work.  It makes you think about a lot of current issues in different ways.", "This is a good course, but be prepared to keep up with the readings -- they get increasingly longer and more difficult towards the end of the semester.  Be sure to find a precept that suits you.", "This is another one of those classes you take to get the EM out of the way. The material has the potential to be interesting but the way it is treated results in it becoming exactly how you'd expect a Christian Ethics course to go, which makes the material trite and boring.", "This is not at all what I expected the course to be. It was too theoretical for my liking and had way too much reading.", "This is probably hypocritical of me, but do the required readings! They are really interesting and varied and will teach you a lot.", "This is probably my favourite course at Princeton. The only thing that seemed to ruin it for people, in my mind, is that too many people went in with a ton of preconceived notions. The point of the class is to hear and understand both sides of the debate on a lot of the issues that get talked about, and the course is cheapened a lot if you don't go in with an open mind. Professor Gregory is extremely good at staying impartial on (almost) every topic covered, to the point that I still don't know what most of his opinions are. As long as you go into the class prepared to do the readings (which are the primary thing tested) and can try to understand the actual arguments in the debate, you're going to both enjoy and do very well in this class without a ton of effort.", "This isn't going to be the most in depth class, but it's going to hit on most of the major contemporary thinkers. Make sure you get a solid conceptual understanding of the different philosophies. \n\nProfessor Gregory can talk at you a little too much in lectures but is pretty good and has some interesting things to say, and he's a nice guy too.", "This was a great course. It challenged the way I think and we got into really deep discussions in precept. Not much outside work besides reading (just 2 short papers). Should definitely take a class like this while at Princeton. Also understanding the perspective of one of the most common religions is really helpful in understanding why people believe the things they do, and how it affects our democracy.", "This was a very meaningful class. Lectures, readings, and precepts were all very well connected and got us thinking about interesting and relevant issues.", "Try to keep up with the readings. It's hard, but worth it.", "Well worth it just for the lectures, but should really do all the readings to make the most of it.", "What you get out of this course will be determined by the effort you put into the readings and discussions.  If you are genuinely interested though, I would recommend taking it.", "You get out what you put in", "You need to take it.

Memorization is the name of the game, and the course currently has no resources to help any of its students. There are no precepts, which greatly contributes to the mass confusion of those students who did not take AP/AP-level biology in high school and which deemphasize the priority of this course in the minds of its students. Every single preceptor (lab TA) is equally unapproachable from my experience for extra help, seeing as they are all 2nd year or so grad students who are out of touch with the machinations of actually going about understanding this material. The review sessions led by the arrogant Anthony Ambrosini were equally awful, as he did nothing actually to review the material, but rather he just went over the answer key for the weekly optional problem set and stared at our blank faces as he ended every single session more than hour early. Unbelievable. Even in his office hours he scoffed at half the questions he received. Do not bother with his review sessions. If you want help, approach Dr. Thieringer. Go to office hours every week. Lectures are important to go to simply because you want to copy down verbatim what the lecturers are saying, because none of it will make sense to you at the time, at 8:30. Find a friend with whom you can exchange notes when one of you misses lecture. Perhaps even record lecture. They are Tuesday and Thursday, so at some point from Friday-Sunday, sit down for 2-3 hours RELIGIOUSLY and review each slide. Trust me, just reviewing the slides will take that long. Then, do the problem set. Then on Sunday-Monday, work on the almost-weekly lab report AND do the textbook reading for the coming week, which should not be too long.

My only warning would be that the class can seem deceptively easy. Problem sets look short, but can take quite a bit of time (though sometimes they actually are pretty quick). You'll also feel like the class doesn't require a lot of work, so you won't give it too much energy from week to week.

Covers some similar topics, but keep in mind that a frequentist teaches ORF 350, whereas a Bayesian (though prof Blei is leaving for Columbia) teaches COS 424. 350 has frequentist stuff like asymptotic properties of estimators, 424 has Bayesian stuff like graphical models. Things might have changed, but some specific algorithm differences are: Discriminant Analysis in 350, HMMs and PCA in 424. I think it's worth taking both, especially if you enjoy this kind of stuff.", "It is advertised as a COS class, but really it's about the math behind machine learning -- expect mostly numbers and symbols. I personally went in knowing I would hate the material, learned a whole lot, came out thinking \"Ok that's done, no regrets (in retrospect, during was other matter), never again.\" The problem sets took time and were annoying, but I don't know if they will be characteristic of future courses.", "It might be worth it to learn the theory, but I'd stay away until you see evidence that the grading policy has been improved.", "It was a fun class! Prof Blei will no longer be teaching it next year, but I hope that the experience will be similar :) I'd recommend!", "It's an ORF class disguised as a COS class. Take COS402 if you're looking for machine learning techniques instead.", "It's not going to be with David Blei anymore, so most of these reviews are useless.

Too bad Prof. Blei is leaving this year.", "Take this course, but it is advised to be prepared to do a lot of individual reading and studies to fully understand the materials.", "Terrible, terrible course. I can't believe I wasted one of my senior spring classes by taking this. Blei's lectures suck, and you'll end up teaching yourself from the book/Google.", "The course has very interesting material, but is poorly administered.  ORF 350 is probably a better choice.", "The course was great through the covered material  - for each homework we had an open questions that forces you to come up with something innovative each week. Unfortunately the readings and the lectures were not the best mix.", "The problem sets and readings were challenging and time consuming, but the material was interesting and useful. Part of the reason I enjoyed the course was Professor Blei and unfortunately he will not be teaching this again.", "The reviews for this class in previous semesters have been fantastic.  I wonder what happened this time around that made things so much worse than previous offerings.\n\nBlei is hilarious and makes lectures a lot of fun.  He's also incredibly bright.  That alone might get him good reviews this time around, as it has in the past.  However, the organization of the course this time around was terrible, and absolutely must be improved.\n\nProblem sets were roughly biweekly, and had to be handed in in class just like the annoyingly trivial reading responses (most of which are not read by the course staff) since apparently none of the TAs have mastered email submission of assignments.  \n\nThe restrictiveness of having to be physically in class to submit homework is somewhat eased by \"late days.\"  However, this highlights another problem with the class.  The material required to complete the problem sets was frequently not taught until near, or even after, the due date.  When emailed about these situations, Blei responded by asking not to be emailed about these situations.  He frequently had no idea what material was being covered in the problem sets at any given time, and explicitly said in class that his relationship to the homework was \"fast and loose\" as though that somehow makes everything ok.  This was only made worse by his frequent (still entertaining) tangents in class that delayed covering necessary material even more. (Also, as a courtesy to anyone who takes this class in the future, please save questions that are obviously outside the scope of what we need to know for after class - some students *frequently* asked esoteric questions on which Blei spent a great deal of time at the expense of examinable material.  Some students were so notorious that I heard people were actually playing drinking games in class, one drink per question from a particular student.) Consequently, students were often left with no choice but to use late days just to give the staff time", "There really aren't that many overviews of machine learning offered here so if you're interested, definitely take the class. It's a fair amount of work, but you do learn a lot.", "This class is JP/thesis in disguise.", "This course has a structural issue: students come to the material from a wide range of mathematical backgrounds and computer science accumen. This course should require stronger probability background, or split into two or three subcourses that cater more to students abilities.", "This course provides a really interesting opportunity to learn about machine learning!  However, since Professor Blei is leaving, the course might be different next year.", "This course was a huge letdown--one of the most overhyped courses I've taken. The material felt like it overlapped in weird ways with so many other COS courses I've taken and Blei's lectures were quite poor. The assignments were disorganized and the expectations were simply never made clear.", "This course when I took it was pretty terrible, largely because of the course organization. The assignments were vague and arbitrarily graded, the problem sets used confusing and conflicting notation, and the TAs were pretty unhelpful. However, if this class is taught by a different professor in a much more organized fashion, the material might be interesting.", "This is a good course for learning basic machine learning algorithms and also a good practice for using them in real world problems.", "This is a good course if you have a background in programming and want to get a general overview of machine learning theory and techniques.", "This is one of the worst classes I have been in at Princeton. I have no idea why it got such good reviews before. What could have been a really interesting class was ruined by an utter lack of care for teaching on the Professor's part. Professor Blei doesn't pay any attention to what is on the problem sets, so we are often assigned difficult homework on material that has not been taught in class. No feedback is given on ope-ended assignments and the TAs can't even answer basic questions about the course material.", "This was an enjoyable class, but the math definitely picks up on the 3rd and 4th assignments.

Prof. Sorensen makes the material interesting and involves the class in the learning process. In addition, the preceptors and Frick staff are extremely receptive to any questions you have and are quick to answer questions. Although the material was challenging, it is key to keep up-to-pace with the information and make sure you prepare for each exam.", "SORENSEN IS AMAZING. If you have to take orgo 2, take it with him! He's hilarious.", "Sorenson is an absolutely fantastic professor!! I may be a little biased as I absolutely loved this class, but his lectures were the high points of my day. Definitely go to lecture, and definitely read the notes. And don't be afraid to go to the preceptors or Professor Sorenson himself with questions, they really  do want to help. \nMake sure to take practice tests before taking the midterms, take them under timed conditions.

When you get to carbonyl chemistry, think simply in terms of steps, don't let yourself get overwhelmed with the many possibilities.", "Study every week!", "TAKE IT", "TAKE ORGO SOMEWHERE ELSE!

This class is excellent, as long as you stay on top of your material, as with any class. Lectures are Tuesday and Thursday. Everyday after lecture, spend 15 minutes over lunch reviewing what was just thrown at without you. You won't be confused. Problem sets are due Thursday so work on them after Tuesday, at which point you should know what to do for the problem sets. Do a more in-depth review sometime on Friday-Sunday, for 1-2 hours on the material you learned for the week. Start studying for exams 5-7 days in advance -- first by reviewing the 7-8 lectures that will be tested, and then by doing all the practice exams that are available. Save the last day for going over mistakes, redoing problems, finalizing your cheat sheets, and quickly skimming through the lectures again. Make sure to understand the examples he puts in the notes, especially those ones that seem complex and just \"challenge problems.\" Cognates of those will find their way onto the exams. You can do it! 304 is a lot more fun than 303. I imagine 304B with Semmelhack is too.", "Take Sorenson's class in the second semester. He is awesome! (But if you don't have to take it, don't take orgo. Your GPA will thank you)", "Take it if necessary.", "Take it if you are an enthusiastic student and find solace in putting in hours at the library. Organic Chemistry really teaches you how to learn and develops study habits like none other. It is also very rewarding and the subject itself is interesting.", "Take it. I mean if you care about your grades a lot then that might be rough because it's not like I got an A but if you think chemistry is interesting take 304. The worst part about orgo is the 8:30 time for 303. I could not immerse myself in the class like i did for 304 and that is definitely a shame.", "Take organic chemistry. It is worth it.", "Take the class with Professor Sorensen!!! He genuinely loves teaching, loves orgo, and it makes you love orgo too (or at least like it more than before). I was frustrated, and afraid of orgo after the first semester because I didn't understand the point of organic chemistry and worked and still didn't do well. Prof. Sorensen completely changed that though. Although I still struggled in the course, I can am fascinated by the subject and its complexities and possibilities.", "Take the course. Even if you don't need to, it was just a joy to learn about chem from so many passionate people.", "Take this and not 304B.", "Take this course if you liked 303 even a little bit! This course really gets at the crux of organic synthesis, and you'll be able to conceptualize so many more reactions afterwards. Have fun drawing the arrows. Professor Sorensen is a great lecturer. When preparing for exams, do all the previous exams and you should be set (there aren't that many).", "Take this course with Sorrensen. And study a lot.", "Take this course! It's not as hard as its reputation makes it seem. Sorenson is an amazing lecturer and his staff works hard to make sure everyone understands.", "Take this. Don't take Semmelhack.", "This course is more challenging than first semester organic chemistry, but the concepts are explained much better, and the class is much more engaging.  I would recommend this class for anyone who is remotely interested in organic chemistry.", "This is a great class, and Sorensen is a wonderful lecturer. The pacing of the class is unusual, it starts very slowly and ends very quickly. If you're fine with memorizing a lot at the end of the semester, and really care about the quality of lecture, take this course. Otherwise, Semmelhack might be better (but I wouldn't know, I don't know what Semmelhack is like second semester).", "This was a fun course, but most people who take it are required to do so.  Some parts are less interesting than others, but the material is definitely useful/important for anything chemistry related.", "You have to go with Sorensen! This was the best class I've taken at Princeton so far and the best teaching experience I've had here too.

You can't do anything about that and everyone's pretty much in the same boat. \n\nOral presentations--practice a lot and try to anticipate any sort of curveball question the professors will throw at you. Brainstorm with your partner possible questions. If you are confused about a concept, you'll probably be asked to explain that concept, so get that cleared up before your presentation.\n\nPartners--if you are allowed to pick partners (which you probably will be doing), pick someone you know you will work well with. Make sure that person has a similar schedule to you and has a similar work ethic. For example, if you are someone who likes to start early but your partner likes to do things last-minute, this probably won't work out, even if the two of you are best fri", "If you're CBE you don't have a choice.", "If you're a CBE, you're going to have to take it anyway. It's a lot of time in lab, but the most painful parts are right before reports are due. Just so you know what to expect, you have 4 experiment cycles. You do 2 written reports, one oral report per partner, and one poster presentation. You can choose your partner, so choose someone you can work with well! Don't procrastinate - do your data analysis as you go. Don't worry, you'll get through it and survive just like the rest of us. :)", "It is so great! You'll learn to write lab reports like a pro, give American Idol-like power point presentations, and have a grand finale pizza and poster presentation session. Pick your partner wisely, because working that closely with one other can bring up some issues. Before going into lab, really read the lab manuals so you can be efficient in lab. Start writing the reports up early so the professors can help you with analysis. The professors really care about the presentation quality of your reports and power point, so focus a lot on how \"pretty\" it is. They really want the data to be reported in the best way, and that goes a lot towards the \"prettiness\" I'm talking about.", "It's required.", "Process data immediately. Start working on analysis right away. Also talk to the professor in charge of your experiment because they'll usually have something they want that they didn't tell you in the lab manual.", "Run away fast from CBE if you still have a chance (really should not have taken you this long to realize your mistake though). This course will literally make you hate your life. The professors grade arbitrarily and their expectations of you are at times totally unreasonable. There was never a clear idea of what one was expected to gain from each experiment and report back to the professors. Just generally a terrible experience. Felt like climbing Mt. Everest while carrying a boulder on your shoulders and slowly being deprived of oxygen and life. When things start to look sort of bright, they quickly disappear and you realize that you will never reach the top and that there will always be three overlooking Gods laughing at you every step of the way on this fruitless ascent.", "So this is it.  You've bs'ed your way through CBE 245.  You still don't know what fugacity is after thermo.  You still aren't sure what the point of sep was, and you suffered dearly though pipes.  Now, it's time for the granddaddy of them all: core lab.  Ever since you were a clueless freshman considering chemical engineering, you heard upperclassmen about core lab...usually under their breaths.  \"(To you) Yes, you should totally become a CBE!  (whispered, usually to a friend) Heh heh, wait until they get to core lab...\"  Even other course reviews tend to talk about how terrible this class is.  To be honest, though, CORE LAB ISN'T THAT BAD.  The truth is, it takes up a lot of time, there's no getting around that.  With six hours in lab per week, you'll be putting a lot of time into it.  Although this already seems like a lot to do, make sure to analyze your data that you collect in each lab before the next one.  This will help you make more informed measurements as labs go on.  Also, get as much feedback as you can on your written work and data before it is due.  Your TA should be willing and able to help with this.  If you do core lab right, it can be one of the most worthwhile experiences of Princeton.  If you don't, you'll end up hating every minute of your life.  So, buckle in, put on your big boy (or girl) pants, and get ready to do some science.", "Talk to your professors (and not your TA's) for your reports, since they're the ones that end up grading it.", "Think of something creative to do on the last day of each cycle that shows your understanding of the lab.", "This course isn't that bad if you START EARLY and ASK QUESTIONS. After every lab period, make sure you've analyzed your data before the next period. Make sure your data is in line with what you expect - if it's not, bring up the discrepancy to your TA or Prof in the next period so that you can either a) understand what went wrong or b) understand why the data's ok and why your expectation was wrong. With your reports, it's really important to figure out what each professor wants emphasized - the way you do this is to ask lots of questions during lab. If you're having trouble analyzing your data, your TA and professor can be really helpful, but you have to analyze it early enough to be able to ask about it. Your TA will also have a good idea about what each professor wants - ask them if there's anything in particular that's important to focus on in the report. The reports will take a lot of time - plan on spending the four  days before the report's due working on core lab a lot.", "Well, you have to take it.

Many students sitting near me would groan in disappointment and confusion when the answers were displayed, yet the professor would simply march on to the next blackbox-type demonstration without making sure that we understood the previous, probably because he insisted on getting through too many examples in each lecture. The online lectures were taken exactly from the textbook, but could not serve as a replacement for reading the chapters because the professor did not even cover all of the material in any chapter. It would have taken me less time and been more effective for me to read the book, but because this class was sucking up so much time already, I rarely went over the text. So, I just went into Monday class always unprepared for the week's material. Because the online and in-person lectures were mandatory, I wasted 2-2.5 hours per week (because sometimes there were two online lectures).

The PSets are great - not time consuming and a nice change of pace after ORF 309, it is not Matlab heavy and you can figure out the programming as you go. Then, there is a midterm in week 7 that is hard to study for, since you are not really sure what you could be tested on. But you just look at the few example problems in the book and the test wasn't too hard (the cheat sheet was imperative for the first time in a class for me). The second half of the class is a whole different story. No psets, no final. Just lectures in the course that may or may not be helpful for the final project. Class attendence dropped and most of the lectures were not immediately understandable (and there were no psets to help us to). The project is very open ended without much direction - which is usually worse than it is good. Start simple and small with stuff that you learned.

It would have been much better had there been only ~30 students and if it was discussion-based. Moreover, it is very difficult to get a good grade not because the class is hard, but because the grading for problem sets is rather arbitrary. It doesn't require you to use any knowledge from class, but rather requires you to be good at wikipedia searches and if you don't mention certain details, you will get points off. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if the averages on problem sets weren't ~90% and if problem sets didn't make up almost all your grade. The only other grade is a final project.\nOverall, I know Nelson has worked hard to plan this course and she has done a great job of choosing which topics to include, but the class size needs to be smaller, grades need to be based more on class discussion, and grading of problem sets  needs to be less nitpicky.", "I loved this course!!!

In reality, this class was, unfortunately, a terrible waste of time. I felt really bad, because both Higgins and Locke are really nice guys, and it was obvious that no one in the class was paying attention.\n\nThe quantitative section was particularly poorly designed. I don't think it was Higgins's fault, either. The issue was that almost everyone had taken WWS 200, which focused more on teaching R than teaching stats (see http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=tbTtAV4y for gripes with WWS 200). The problem is that the methods lab's goal appears to be to teach programming to people who already know stats but don't know any programming. But because of WWS 200, everyone already knew programming and didn't know any stats! As a result, almost everything Higgins went over in lab was identical to what Ratkovic tried to go over in WWS 200. This, of course, led to disastrous results (one girl in my task force literally asked what a linear regression was about four weeks into my research seminar... and the rest of the seminar vigorously nodded and said, \"yes, what's that?\"). Suggestion: make WWS 200 a stats-only class with no programming, and let Higgins teach the programming in the methods lab (he's a better teacher than Ratkovic anyway).  That way, you might actually learn something in the quantitative section.\n\nThe qualitative section's grading was ridiculously arbitrary. The reason for this was that the guidelines were very unclear, and as a result, people were marked down for things that weren't on the instructions (e.g. \"this was all good but you could have added a paragraph about x, so B+\").\n\nThe lab assignments are supposed to theoretically help you with your JP.

Katz is a really interesting lecturer. Sometimes he forgets that his audience doesn't know quite as much as he does, but in general he engages with the class and makes the material interesting. You may find yourself questioning your long standing beliefs about language and right and wrong. Definitely do study the lecture notes for the midterm and final.

If you're interested in how English came to be as it is, definitely take this class!", "Only take this if you are very interested because grading is very harsh.", "Please do not take this course. It is by far the worst course I have ever taken at Princeton.  Even though I've taken 6 years of Latin and LIN 20, it took me over 25 hours to complete each of the five impossible homework assignments.  The workload was unbearable (including a Dean's Date 7-10 page research paper AND a final exam), Katz was more show than substance (e.g. he liked to show off that he knew everyone's names but he was not a great lecturer), the readings are boring, grading is unnecessarily harsh, the midterm and final test the tiniest details that have nothing to do with the overall significance of the course, and the course had zero structure whatsoever.  This is all coming from a student who had, at one point, considered majoring in Classics, English, or even completing an independent concentration in Linguistics - I now run from these departments and will probably never take a course again in any of these.  This was a terrible course not worth the hours of work (I feel like I learned nothing even though I labored away for hours) and it was a massive disappointment.  My biggest regret about this class was not dropping it.  If you want the OED to be your only friend for a semester (the work this class requires will actually prevent you from maintaining friendships and good grades in other classes, trust me on that), then go for it. I was not about that life and hated living on my computer, constantly looking at the OED or digging through Google for information that should have been taught during lectures. I don't think I can emphasize this enough: please do not take this.  Don't be fooled into thinking that the course will be simple after the first few lectures, where I actually believed Katz would be a good lecturer. Save yourself the stress, especially if you're not a humanities student, and find a better LA.  I have nothing but hatred for this course and regret the time I spent suffering through it.", "So. I have to say that this is a definitely interesting course, but I'll start with the professor. Joshua Katz' got attitude, though he is a very good lecturer and his notes are interesting and need-to-be-memorized for the exams. The material is super interesting. We went over how spelling changes and sound changes marks English as an individual language (though we never get to adequately define 'word', 'language' or 'dialect'). I heard that Katz does not teach this every year, so if it comes up then if you are really into Linguistics and are good with humanities classes then you should take it. I was not a humanities-person so I did not do as well as I would have liked, but definitely memorize his notes because he wants you to know them explicitly for the exams. It is hard to say that I would recommend or not recommend the course. Let me put it this way... It's that one course that you take and are glad that it is over but are glad that you took it. I do not want to ever take this course again though I would be tempted since the class is lots of fun since Katz is really funny and you go over really interesting things but I struggled with the exams and the problems sets. It is a very interesting course, but for that you must pay the consequences. However I did talk to a person who was not into it and couldn't get into it no matter how much they tried but the thing is that I also met people who really struggled with grades and assignments. I would definitely recommend it if it were pdf-able, but sadly it is not.", "Stay on top of the readings and review lecture notes frequently.", "Such an interesting class with really enjoyable lectures. Take it!", "TAKE IT. Seriously. Professor Katz is amazing and learning about English is interesting, though the man could probably teach a course about paint drying and make it engaging. The materials in the lectures were easily modified according to student questions and interests, which was great, but also meant that the curriculum wasn't very well-defined. As a result, the exams felt like a collection of trivia, which was frustrating. The course would have made more sense if it was only based on papers. Regardless, I recommend it unconditionally.", "TAKE THIS COURSE - it is not easy but it really made me think about so many things in so many new ways.  I do not regret taking this course for a moment.  and my friends regret not taking it.", "Take it!  Even if you don't like linguistics, you probably will after taking this course.", "Take it! But really. It's the best course at Princeton. Every lecture was a crazy & dreamy miasma of knowledge and humor, like stumbling into an uncringeworthy version of Dead Poets Society. You think I'm exaggerating here. I'm actually just being as specific as possible.", "Take it! Or take anything taught by Joshua Katz. I took this class because I needed something to fill a slot and a distribution requirement and it looked mildly interesting. It turned out to be much more than that, and I'm really glad I took it. I learned a lot about an interesting subject that I otherwise may never have thought about. Best class I've taken at Princeton yet.", "Take it!!! Katz's lectures are always entertaining, and the information is fascinating. Be aware, though, that (at least Spring 2014) you can't PDF the class, and the problem sets do take a long time. Even so, I thoroughly enjoyed the class. If you can't take this class, try to take at least one class with Professor Katz while at Princeton!", "Take it, but be prepared to work very hard. This is no easy A class.", "Take it, but know that it requires work. If you find words and origins fascinating, you'll learn so many new things and love it the entire time.

Katz is also super accessible.", "Take this course if Professor Katz is teaching it.", "Take this course the next time it's offered! I'm an engineer and was extremely glad to have this class in my schedule. Language is such a fundamental thing for humans that it's really enlightening to break it down and study where it came from and how it's developed and what it means. Professor Katz is wonderful and lectures are always engaging. The tests, exams, and homework are all fair and if you work hard it will pay off directly.", "Take this course!

Professor Katz's lectures are amazing and almost unparalleled on campus. Assignments are relatively short, and the projects towards the end of the semester do not take too much time. Because the course material is general enough to be accessible to all students regardless of major, and because Professor Katz teaches it, everyone should seriously consider taking this class.", "This is probably a good way to figure out if you like linguistics or not.

We all use language on a day-to-day basis, and hardly anybody ever thinks about what it is or how it got to be that way. This course covers both in a rigorous and eye-opening way while still managing to throw in oodles of fascinating trivia and general discussion. Students of humanities, social science, and engineering will all find much of interest here. That's not to say this is a perfect course: it isn't. Lectures (though spectacular in general) sometimes get sidetracked, precepts are less than they could be, and the problem sets and exams are occasionally frustrating (in addition to being moderately tough overall). Even so, it is very much worth your while to take this, no matter who you are at the university.

Really only take it out of necessity or strong interest in the subject.", "The course is useful and interesting.", "The readings are really helpful.", "This class is interesting if you want to learn more about C as well as how a computer carries out certain tasks. I would recommend this class to those who are going to be doing a lot of programming in the future. Also if you want to be a more serious programmer. However, if you are someone who enjoyed 126, take 226 first, then decide if this class is right for you because it is a harder than 226. Lectures are helpful but not entirely necessary. If you want to stay up to date with the material, the lectures are far better than the books. You 100% need to go to precepts. Precepts are where you will learn what you need for the assignments. Also, precepts are way more code based than the lectures. Thus, for someone who is more interested in programming than theory, the precepts are solid. I had Dondero and he is a very good preceptor. He explains everything very well and talks about the assignments in precept, sometimes even giving hints. The assignments are hard, start very early. Learn how to use gdb early. It will help for assignments 1-3. Try to be as careful as possible when writing your code because sometimes the problem can come down to missing one letter and it could take 5 hours to find the bug. They are incredibly difficult to debug. While lab ta's are definitely helpful, they generally aren't very well prepared for helping on 217 assignments. Assembly and heap manager are hard assignments. For the exams, first look at the past exams that your professor has given out. For example, I had Pai and his previous tests were Spring 2010 and 2012. The exams have an enormous amount of variation from professor to professor. So find the ones from your professor's years then practice those. Read the systems book for the final exam, it will help a lot, depending on who your professor is. \nI took 226 with 217 and it is doable. If you decide to take them at the same time you have to work ahead. At first, the two classes together are manageable. However, later in the semeste", "This course is valuable only because of Dondero. I can't necessarily speak for all of the other preceptors, but the course itself has a number of issues, in that its lectures are pretty detached from the core of the course, and grading can sometimes be very harsh, though they are very transparent in their grading. All things considered, I did not do well in this course, but feel as if I learned a lot.", "This course requires a little more time for the assignments, but is not as heavy on the theory as COS 226.  It is a fun course, though, and you will learn a lot.", "This course was pretty interesting and really begins to give students a feel for the machine underneath, especially students coming from 126.\nIf you come into this class knowing any C, you will find the first half of the semester very easy/boring as the systems part of the course does not really begin until after midterms.", "This is a class that will put you through a lot of work that is focused on recreating simple versions of important programming tools. Some find the work tedious and uninteresting, but it does give you a good appreciation and understanding of how to really use tools to write good, high-performing code.", "This truly is a great course that is both a lot of fun and teaches you fascinating things about how computers truly work. Even as experienced programmers, computers can seem magical at times and this course really illuminated their inner workings. Bob Dondero is obviously the most amazing teacher ever, and although he is lecturing next semester, he is still teaching one precept, so go for it! He answers every question on Piazza in minutes and his way of explaining concepts with the utmost clarity and precision is astonishing. If you take it with him, you will probably find COS 217 to be one of your favourite classes at Princeton, as I definitely have.", "Very good course but I would not recommend it if you're trying to get the COS certificate.", "You must get Dondero as your preceptor.

The second half features a thematic approach to a variety of topics: 9/11, women and gender, religious conversion, interfaith relations, youth, mosques as institutions, and Islamophobia.", "termid": "1144", "classes": [{"classnum": "43111", "enroll": "8", "limit": "15", "starttime": "7:30 pm", "section": "S01", "endtime": "10:20 pm", "roomnum": "207", "days": "M", "bldg": "Frist Campus Center"}]},
